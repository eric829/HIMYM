        <p>2 - The Scorpion and the Toad</p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: Marshall and Lily have together for nine wonderful years until she dumped him and ran off to San Francisco. The healing process was taking a long time. Then, one night he made a giant leap forward.</p>
        <p><em>At MacLaren's.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Alright, see you guys later.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: I'll walk you out.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: See ya.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: You just checked out Robin's ass.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: What? No. I... Barney, I was...</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Dude, that's awesome! You're finally forgetting about that short redhead.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Lily.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Yes, Lily, thank you. That was gonna drive me crazy all night. Hey, Ted! Marshall's just checked out your girlfriend's ass.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: I did not Ted...</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Awesome! You're finally getting better.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: This is the moment I've been waiting for. Starting tonight, I'm gonna teach you how to live. Ted, you're out of chance, Marshall's in.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Yes!</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Oh, God!</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Marshall, being a single guy in New York city is like... Pfff... What does everybody like?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Candy.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Yeah! It's like being in a candy store. You just walk right in and grab yourself some Whoppers. Yeah. Is Whoppers the best ones?</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Mounds.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Milk Duds.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Gobstoppers.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Um...</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong> <strong>from 2030</strong>: This went on for another hour. I'll just skip to the end.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Dubble Bubbles.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Nice! Marshall, we're doing this. I am not taking no for an answer.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Fine.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong> <em>(on the phone)</em>: Hey Robin. Marshall checked out your ass.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Ted, what is wrong with you?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong> <em>(on the phone)</em>: He checked out my ass? Hey, tell him thanks. I felt like I was having a bad ass day. Cool. See ya.</p>
        <p><em>Robin reaches her apartment. Lily is on her landing.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Lily.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: It is a great ass.</p>
        <p><strong><em>CREDIT TITLES</em></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: None of us had seen Lily in three months. There were so many unanswered questions, so many things to say.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Your hair is adorable!</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Thank you! <em>(They hug)</em></p>
        <p><em>At MacLaren's.</em><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: Meanwhile, Barney was taking Marshall out to meet women for the first time since he was 17.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Hi. Have you met Marshall?</p>
        <p><strong>Woman</strong>: Hi.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Hi. Look how sweaty my hands are! It's weird, right? Uh, sweat. Like this... Smelly water coming out of your skin. It was nice meeting you.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: I-I-I Hate to interrupt but, uh... Do you like magic?</p>
        <p><strong>Woman</strong>: Umm... I guess. <em>(Barney makes a trick, Umm, I guess is writing on his hand).</em> Oh my God! (<em>Barney does it again, Oh my God! appears on his hand)</em> Anyway, Marshall here is awesome. Salad in a bag? His idea!</p>
        <p><em>In a snack bar.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Dude, you were awesome last night. You were charming, you were funny. You were totally working that girl.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: You went home with her!</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Yes, I did. But she told me that if it wasn't for me you would've had a shot with her. So in hypothetical terms, you scored last night! All right! Hypothetical high five! Nice! Tonight, we're gonna go to the bar...</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Barney, no, I'm not going out with you ever again.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Come on! I'll teach you all my strategies!</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Oh, really?</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: My favorite, number seven. Create a mystery about yourself. That way, they become so intrigued that they have to hang out with you all night.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Oh, come on. Does that really work?</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Dammit that's intriguing! OK, I'm in.</p>
        <p><em>At the apartment, Robin arrives.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: You've gotta hear this.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: You will not believe what just happened.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: You go first.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: I find a 1939 penny on the subway. Just imagine the history this little copper guy's seen...</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Lily is back in town.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: And you let me go first?! Have you seen her?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Uh, yeah. I actually went apartment hunting with her today.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: How is she doing?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: You're not gonna like it.</p>
        <p><em>[FLASHBACK]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: I am doing great. This summer, best thing ever. San Francisco is so happening right now.</p>
        <p><em>[END OF FLASHBACK]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: She's happy? Marshall had the worst summer of his life and she's happy. And I suppose her art program was fulfilling or whatever.</p>
        <p><em>[FLASHBACK]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Oh, the art program, best thing ever.</p>
        <p><em>In San Francisco, Lily is painting.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Man</strong>: Oh my God, this is your best work. In all my years teaching, I've never seen anything so... Needless to say, this is art! I can't teach you anything. <em>(The man is giving Lily his paintbrush).</em></p>
        <p><em>In New-York, with Robin.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: But the best part of SF - oh that's what we call San Francisco - the people. Even just riding around on the bus all summer, it was like a human tapestry.</p>
        <p><em>In San Francisco, in a bus.</em><strong>Man 1</strong>: Hi, I'm Mike. I'm a Buddhist monk slash adventure writer travel.</p>
        <p><strong>Woman</strong>: I'm Paula. I sing in a punk band for children. Yeah!</p>
        <p><strong>Man 2</strong>: I'm Dan. I'm a neurosurgeon. You are stunning, by the way.</p>
        <p><em>In New-York.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Wow, I am so happy for you.</p>
        <p><em>[END OF FLASHBACK]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Oh, she's such a... godda... God! After what she did to Marshall, she should come back here devastated. Crawling over the broken glass of her own shame and regret.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: You never chose sides. I respect that.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: She's unbelievable! Unbelievable!</p>
        <p><em>(Marshall arrives.)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Unbelievable? What's unbelievable?</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Uh, listen Marshall...</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Ted found a penny on the subway and it's old and that's interesting.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Way to go.</p>
        <p><em>(Marshall goes into his bedroom.)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: OK, first of all, that is interesting. Second, we have to tell him.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: No, we don't. He's just starting to get better. Going out with Barney. How do you think he'll feel when he hears Lily's moved on?</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: She's moved on?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Well, it happens. I've fallen out of love faster than that before. Sometimes, boom, with no warning whatsoever. One day we're in love, the next day, he's dead to me. But we're great! Honey?</p>
        <p><em>At MacLaren's.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Let's review Barney's rules for mating without dating. Lesson two: corollary five.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Make a beautiful woman feel self-conscious and unattractive and she'll be putty in your hands.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Excellent. Have you chosen your entrée?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: I have. A sweet brunette, eight o'clock. Nine o'clock. Ten; thirty. She's walking to the bar.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Her? Really? No, you're right. Ambition is the enemy of success. OK, hit it.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong> <em>(to the girl)</em>: Hey four-eyes. You got astigmatism or something? I'm sorry, I was trying to be playful but I just got out of a lonf relationship. I have no idea what I'm doing! I'm Marshall.</p>
        <p><strong>Girl</strong>: Hi Marshall. Amy. Don't worry, I've been there. Hold on.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Nice recovery. I think it's working.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Um, Amy, this is my friend Barney. Barney, this is Amy.</p>
        <p><strong>Amy</strong>: Hey Barney, nice to meet you.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Hi. Amy, do you like... magic?</p>
        <p><em>At the apartment.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: I hate you.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: I am so sorry. It's a sickness. I'm the real victim here.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Twice! Twice in a row you took my candy! That was my candy!</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: I know but tonight...</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: No, forget it. You're such a jackass!</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong> <em>(with you're a jerk writing on his hand)</em>: I though you were gonna call me a jerk. All right, I'm sorry. But I will make it up to you. Tonight, we'll go to a college bar near NYU. The Scorpion &amp; The Toad. I figure in a younger crowd you'll seem more mature, more worldly. And, as a third-year law student, more smarter.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: OK, but no magic. <em>(He turns to Barney who disappeared).</em> How did you do that?</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: I'm taking a leak, dumb-ass.</p>
        <p><em>In a building.</em><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: Robin and I went apartment hunting with Aunt Lily.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: But I need the freedom to really chase my passion, which was painting but now, I think it's music, or spoken words. Maybe both. God, isn't life amazing.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: It is so great to see you Ted. Ah! I'm gonna get the key for the lockbox.</p>
        <p><em>(She leaves.)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: What?</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: She's miserable. She's realized she's made a huge mistake. Her and Marshall will be back together in a week, I love it!</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: No, you just want Lily to be miserable. The truth is she's happy.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Trust me. I've known Lily for nine years.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Trust me, I'm a girl!</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Yeah. But you're Canadian.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Why do you always have to bring that up?</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: You're our weird neighbors!</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: You bring it up every time...</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: No, alright. Five bucks says she still wants Marshall.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: You're on.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Five American bucks.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Dammit! OK, so how do we get the truth out of her?</p>
        <p>Ted: Tequila. It's her weakness. Three shots, she tells you the truth about anything.</p>
        <p><em>(Lily come back.)</em>Lily: I hope this is my new home. <em>(She comes in the apartment)</em> Yeah, I'm gonna take that first apartment.</p>
        <p><em>At the apartment, Barney knocks at the door, Marshall opens.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Marshall Eriksen, suit up!</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: No way.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Yeah you're good in that. Let's go.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Wait. Empty your pockets. Come on.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Come on...</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Sleeves.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: There is nothing in my sl...</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Oh is that right?</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Huh? Huh? Let's go.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Behind my ear.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Oh there is nothing behind your... Ohh!</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Ohh!</p>
        <p><em>At The Scorpion &amp; the Toad bar.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Girl</strong>: Yeah, I'm in pre-law. The workload's killing me though.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Oh, tell me about it. I'm a third year at Columbia Law, so... If the workload does kill you I can probably get a conviction. Yeah.</p>
        <p><em>In an other spot of the Scorpion &amp; the Toad.</em><strong>Barney</strong> <em>(to a girl)</em>: You must be majoring in chemistry 'cause what I'm picking up between us is, uh... <em>(The girl leaves / to the girl's friend)</em> College lesbian phase.</p>
        <p><em>Back to Marshall and the first girl.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Girl</strong>: Listen, I gotta go. But it'd be great to see you again.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Yes, it would. It really would.</p>
        <p><strong>Girl</strong>: Maybe I'll see you here sometimes.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Probably not. I'm never here, so...</p>
        <p><strong>Girl</strong>: You know, I do have a phone number.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Great. Nice.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Hi, I'm Barney.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Do you mind giving my friend your phone number?</p>
        <p><strong>Girl</strong>: Sure.</p>
        <p><em>In a cab.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Whoo! I did it! I got a girl's phone number! Oh, and her handwriting is so cute. Look. I'll take her out for Chinese food and then we'll walk through the park. It'll be so... What?</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Sorry buddy, I'm taking this one too.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong> <em>(choking Barney)</em>: I'll kill you!</p>
        <p><em>At Robin's apartment.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: And then I discovered this area, North beach. Best beach ever! Oh, I've been blabbering on about my summer. How are you guys doing? And hey, how is Marshall?</p>
        <p><em>In the cab, Marshall still chokes Barney.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Gimme the card! I swear I'm gonna...</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: I'm not giving you...</p>
        <p><em>Back at Robin's.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Terrific.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: That is so good to hear. <em>(Lily's phone rings).</em> Oh, hold on. This could be about he apartment. <em>(She leaves the room).</em></p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: OK, we're way past truth-telling Lily and about to hit Cinco-de-Mayo-1998 Lily, and I'm not cleaning that up again. So, congratulations. You win, she's happy.</p>
        <p><em>(Lily come back.)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: I didn't get it. That first apartment. I... I waited too long and somebody else got it. <em>(She starts crying).</em></p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Interesting. Wow Lily, you, uh, seem to be having a pretty strong reaction to losing this apartment. I wonder is it because it reminds you of something you lost because you couldn't commit?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: No, Lily you're crying over the crown moulding and the real hardwood floor. There's no deeper meaning, right Lily? Just quit crying and tell him.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: The apartment is a metaphor for Marshall! <em>(Robin gives back Ted his five dollars)</em></p>
        <p><em>In the cab</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Stop it!</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: You don't want to see me when I'm angry!</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Stop! If we can't settle this like gentlemen, then no one gets the number. <em>(He sends the card across the window).</em></p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Stop the cab! <em>(Marshall gets out of the car)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: No, wait. Come on. Wait. Marshall! 81st and 1st please. <em>(He pulls the card out of his sleeve)</em>. Oh, she does have a cute handwriting.</p>
        <p><em>In a snack-bar.</em><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: About hangovers - everyone has their own special remedy.</p>
        <p><strong>Waiter</strong>: Morning guys, what can I get you?</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Shhh! Bring me the dirtiest, greasiest tuna melt you got. And a milkshake.</p>
        <p><strong>Waiter</strong>: For you, sir?</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Gravy.</p>
        <p><strong>Waiter</strong>: You want that gravy on something?</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Surprise me.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: I'd take you with gravy if my boyfriend wasn't sitting right here! Just kidding. I'm good.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: What are you charpy about?</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: She's still drunk from last night.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: I don't think so! Whoo!</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Look, if you want Marshall back so bad, how come it took you two days to ask about him?</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: I was dying to ask. I was just trying to play it cool. But really...</p>
        <p><em>[FLASHBACK, Robin and Lily visit an apartment]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: But it's good, I mean work's great...</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Say something about Marshall. Where is Marshall? How's Marshall? What's Marshall doing right now? <em>(They are now with Ted in an other building)</em> Shut up and talk about Marshall. Shut up and talk about Marshall! Shut up and talk about Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Aaah I gotta ask! <em>(Then, the three of them are in Robin's apartment)</em> And, hey, how is Marshall?</p>
        <p><em>[END OF FLASHBACK]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: It was such an awful summer! I just wanted to get back here and see him.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: But I thought your summer was great?!</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Not exactly...</p>
        <p><em>[FLASHBACK, in San Francisco, Lily paints]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Man</strong>: Oh my God! This is your best work?! In all my years teaching I've never seen something so... needless. To say this is art... I can't teach you anything.</p>
        <p><em>[END OF FLASHBACK]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: So all those interesting people you met on the bus...?</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Yeah, um...</p>
        <p><em>[FLASHBACK, in a bus]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Man</strong>: I'm Mike. I'm a Buddhist monk slash adventure writer travel.</p>
        <p>I'm Paula. I sing in a punk band for children. I'm Dan. I'm a neurosurgeon. You are stunning, by the way.</p>
        <p><em>[END OF FLASHBACK]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: I never got in touch because I was too embarrassed. I screwed everything up. I have no job, no place to live. I lost the love of my life. Look, I know I have no right to ask this but do you think Marshall would take me back?</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: In a heartbeat. If you called him up, yeah, he'd take you back with open arms.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Wow. So, maybe I should call him?</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Maybe. No! This is... Ooww... Hold on. Look. If you're gonna go back to him, I don't wanna hear the word &quot;maybe&quot;. &quot;Maybe&quot; cannot be in your vocabulary. This break-up almost killed him. And he cannot go through it again. So, unless you're absolutely certain, stay the hell away from him.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong> <em>(laughing)</em>: This guy like pennies!</p>
        <p><em>At MacLaren's</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Hi Marshall.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: No, go away, I don't want to talk to you.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: OK. I know what I did a couple nights back was is in a moral grey area. But the great news is she loved you. If things had gone your way, you'd gone out a couple time, I think she definitely would've had s*x with you.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: There is no &quot;would&quot; in s*x. There totally is. I'm just no good at this Barney! I'm good at being in a couple. I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend. Being single, forget it.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: You can't give up now. What if I told you that you could relive that night with the exact same conversations, the exact same jokes, only this time you get her and I don't.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: That's not possible.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Oh, but it is. She has... Wait for it. Here it comes. Almost there...an identical twin. Yes!</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: A twin isn't the same person.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Of course, it is. What do you think &quot;identical&quot; means? &quot;Ident-&quot; - same. &quot;-ical&quot; - person. Same person. Hey, we could double date.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Fine.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Ah!</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: But you have to promise me you're not gonna steal my new twin and leave me with your old, used-up twin.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Used-up? They're a human being Marshall.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: So Uncle Marshall and Uncle Barney went out on a double date with the twins.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: How are you doing?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Great. Amazing. This is so much fun. Me and the girl are really cliking.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: You are. You definitely are. Listen, you're gonna have to leave now. I just talked with the twins and, get this, I'm going home with both of them! Yeah. That's happening.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: It is impossible that you're doing this to me again.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: But they're twins.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: You said to me that being single would be like being in a candy store.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Well, it's not like a candy store. It's a lawless, post-apocalyptic wasteland. I may be your best friend...</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Ted's my best friend.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>:...but in this world it's every hombre for himself. That's what being single is. And after nine years of captivity, that is the single greatest lesson I can teach you about surviving in the wild. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have two unique breasts an two duplicates waiting for me. <em>(Barney rejoins the twins, Marshall leaves the bar).</em> Oh bad news. Marshall got food poisoning.</p>
        <p><strong>Twin 1</strong>: What?</p>
        <p><strong>Twin 2</strong>: That's so bad. I really liked him.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Yeah. I guess we're just a threesome tonight.</p>
        <p><em>Outside of MacLaren's, Marshall runs into Lily.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Lily. What are you doing here?</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Oh, I-I was just walking by. I wasn't... Oh, you mean, New-York? My program ended. It was just great. Just lots of fun. It was awful. It was the worst mistake I ever made. I'm so sorry Marshall. And, hello.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Lily, this was the worst summer of my life.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: I know. It was the worst summer of my life.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: It was the hardest thing I've ever had to go through.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Can we please get back together?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: All that crap you said to me about &quot;we need to figure out who we are outside of us, and we need to learn to do things on our own.&quot;. It broke my heart. Three months ago, you broke my heart.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Can we please get back together?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Lily, you were right. All that crap was right. So, no. No, we can't get back together. We shouldn't. At least, not right now.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Wow. OK. Yeah. Wi... Will we still see each other?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I don't know. This is all really new to me. I just got out of a long relationship. I like your hair.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Thanks. I, uh, figured, new city, new color - uh, old color. <em>(Music 'It's gonna be different this time' / Later).</em> And the pizza there. Worst pizza ever! I'm so glad to be back in New-York.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Listen, if there is anything I can do to even begin to make things up to you.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Actually, there's maybe something you can do for me. But you can never ever ask me why.</p>
        <p><em>In MacLaren's, Barney is still with the twins.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: So then, I was promoted to assistant ménage-er. Manager. Why do I keep doing that? <em>(Lily arrives.)</em> Lily?</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: You gave me Chlamydia, you jerk! <em>(She throws a drink at his face and leaves)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: So, where was I? Ah yes. Assistant ménage-er. I did it again. I can't believe it!</p>
        <p><em>(Lily shows up again)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: You gave my twin sister Chlamydia! You slime! <em>(She throws a second drink at his face and leaves, following by the twins).</em></p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Wait, wait, I know magic. Well played, Eriksen. Well played.</p>
