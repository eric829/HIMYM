        <p>18 - Moving Day</p>
        <p>Kids, in the spring of 2007, everything was great between me and Robin.</p>
        <p>So we decided to try and make it even better.</p>
        <p>We decided to move in together.</p>
        <p>So, I can have the moving truck here by 8:00 am.</p>
        <p>Does that sound good to everybody?</p>
        <p>By the way, what are you guys doing with Ted's room?</p>
        <p>'Cause if you need help with the rent, I'll take it.</p>
        <p>Why would you want to live with us?</p>
        <p>I don't call what you guys do &quot;living.&quot;</p>
        <p>Here's the deal, I need a room closer to the bar.</p>
        <p>It takes me exactly 23 minutes to get a girl from the bar back to my apartment.</p>
        <p>A lot can go wrong in 23 minutes.</p>
        <p>This is going to be so hot.</p>
        <p>She's paying.</p>
        <p>I swear, if he doesn't call me back, I'm going to go through with this.</p>
        <p>Please hurry, sir.</p>
        <p>I want to do dirty stuff with you.</p>
        <p>Stuff I won't let him do.</p>
        <p>Every red light run is an extra $20.</p>
        <p>Baby?</p>
        <p>Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It was all my fault.</p>
        <p>I am so drunk.</p>
        <p>When I'm this drunk, I go crazy!</p>
        <p>I bet you do.</p>
        <p>Check this out.</p>
        <p>What up NYPD?</p>
        <p>So close.</p>
        <p>See? If I had a room here all I have to do is get them upstairs.</p>
        <p>Come on, guys. It'll be great!</p>
        <p>We'll come in after you guys are asleep and I'll be gone before you wake up.</p>
        <p>So, you get to have s*x and we get to wake some skanky girl up in the morning and kick her out?</p>
        <p>God, Lily.</p>
        <p>Some guy just told her that he loved her then pretended to go to the bathroom and never came back you can't make her a cup of coffee?</p>
        <p>Real nice.</p>
        <p>I put all your heavy jackets in this box marked &quot;winter.&quot;</p>
        <p>And all your colorful sweaters in this box marked &quot;Bill Cosby.&quot;</p>
        <p>Make fun, but America loved that guy for a reason.</p>
        <p>Wow!</p>
        <p>Almost done.</p>
        <p>Not so fast.</p>
        <p>Take your sword.</p>
        <p>Wow.</p>
        <p>End of an era.</p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>It's a bummer to break up the set, but you're going to need that sword.</p>
        <p>It's true... my building is infested with dragons.</p>
        <p>Looks like our little boy is finally moving out.</p>
        <p>It seems like just yesterday he was a cute little freshmen.</p>
        <p>Discovering Reggae and ultimate Frisbee.</p>
        <p>He did it later than the other kids but we never pushed him.</p>
        <p>We knew he'd get there.</p>
        <p>You haven't moved in yet, have you?</p>
        <p>Good. You guys have to take this quiz.</p>
        <p>I found it in a magazine.</p>
        <p>It's called the &quot;Are you ready to move in together?&quot; quiz.</p>
        <p>Well, if it's anything like you're &quot;Are you wearing panties&quot; quiz, I'm out.</p>
        <p>Question one, Ted, &quot;Do you want to move in with Robin?&quot;</p>
        <p>Mm. Yes.</p>
        <p>Oh, you got the first one wrong.</p>
        <p>The answer is &quot;no,&quot; you secretly want to be single and hang out with your awesome friend Barney.&quot;</p>
        <p>Question two.</p>
        <p>Robin, &quot;Do you think you can score a hotter guy than Ted?&quot;</p>
        <p>Correct. The answer was awkward silence.</p>
        <p>Question three, &quot;Did I just make up this quiz to prove a point?&quot;</p>
        <p>Yes.</p>
        <p>Yes, I did.</p>
        <p>Really? You mean it's not from Old Yellow Legal Pad Magazine?</p>
        <p>So? We all agree?</p>
        <p>We move Ted's stuff back up here?</p>
        <p>Mm... no. We're still moving in together.</p>
        <p>Why? This is crazy.</p>
        <p>Ted you're throwing your life away. This girl is blinding you.</p>
        <p>With her shiny hair and her boobed shaped boobs.</p>
        <p>This is bad for you, too, you know.</p>
        <p>How are you going to feel when he sees you without any makeup?</p>
        <p>I'm not wearing makeup right now.</p>
        <p>Holy crap, you're beautiful.</p>
        <p>All right then, how will you feel when you can't sneak the occasional cigarette?</p>
        <p>Oh, come on, Robin doesn't smoke.</p>
        <p>Wait, do you?</p>
        <p>Of course not. Why?</p>
        <p>Don't tell me how to live my life!</p>
        <p>Ted, I can't let you do this.</p>
        <p>Come on. This is happening.</p>
        <p>So instead of fighting it why, why don't you just help?</p>
        <p>You want me to help you?</p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>Okay, Ted.</p>
        <p>I'll help you.</p>
        <p>Can't believe we actually got him to take a box down.</p>
        <p>Maybe he's finally getting on board.</p>
        <p>Where's the truck?</p>
        <p>Where's Barney?</p>
        <p>Wait for it.</p>
        <p>I can't believe this! Everything I own in the world is in there.</p>
        <p>Except for this box of pot lids.</p>
        <p>And the sword.</p>
        <p>I'm going to kill him. I swear to God I'm going to kill him!</p>
        <p>Right. Maybe I'll just hold on to that. For now.</p>
        <p>Marshall, we live alone.</p>
        <p>This is so great!</p>
        <p>We can finally do all the things we always said we wanted to do if we lived alone.</p>
        <p>Oh, I know what I want to start with.</p>
        <p>So, here we are, right?</p>
        <p>Sitting around the apartment naked.</p>
        <p>Awesome.</p>
        <p>Yep.</p>
        <p>It's not as awesome as I thought it would be.</p>
        <p>My butt itches.</p>
        <p>I'm cold.</p>
        <p>I noticed.</p>
        <p>Yeah, like you're one to talk, Pointy.</p>
        <p>Barney, I don't know if you got my other 47 messages, but if my stuff isn't here within the hour I'm calling the cops.</p>
        <p>This is the last time I'm calling you.</p>
        <p>Because my charger's in the back of the truck.</p>
        <p>Don't worry, it's Barney. He'll bring the stuff back.</p>
        <p>No, it's just... I was really looking forward to settling in, you know?</p>
        <p>Maybe setting up my TV.</p>
        <p>Watching a movie in bed.</p>
        <p>What?</p>
        <p>Do we really want a TV in the bedroom?</p>
        <p>I thought we did.</p>
        <p>I'm not sure that we do.</p>
        <p>Well, where else would we put my TV?</p>
        <p>We could just put it in our storage unit in the basement.</p>
        <p>But wouldn't we miss my TV?</p>
        <p>Would we?</p>
        <p>Yes, we would.</p>
        <p>We've had that TV for a long time and we would feel more at home if it were setup in our bedroom.</p>
        <p>We need wine, don't we?</p>
        <p>Yes, we do.</p>
        <p>Should we, um, move this to the bedroom?</p>
        <p>Why?</p>
        <p>Ted doesn't live here anymore.</p>
        <p>We can do it wherever we want.</p>
        <p>You know what else?</p>
        <p>We don't have to be quiet anymore.</p>
        <p>We can be as loud as we want.</p>
        <p>Okay, I think we need to lay down some ground rules.</p>
        <p>Just because we can be loud doesn't mean we have to be loud.</p>
        <p>And although it might turn you on, you screaming, &quot;I'm the best,&quot; doesn't do much for me.</p>
        <p>Well, it's a lot better than yelling, &quot;Ted's not here,&quot; over and over again.</p>
        <p>Well, at least what I said is true.</p>
        <p>Well, that was unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Well, since I only have one box I figure I might as well unpack it.</p>
        <p>Mm, where do you think we should put it?</p>
        <p>Well, unless you have a separate pot lid room, I was thinking the cupboard.</p>
        <p>What?</p>
        <p>Uh, the thing is my kitchen is kind of small.</p>
        <p>And, um, I already have a bunch of pot lids and mine come with pots, so...</p>
        <p>You're saying there's no way to make room for the single box of stuff I try to move into our place?</p>
        <p>Well, why don't you just take it down to the...</p>
        <p>Do not say storage space.</p>
        <p>I was going to say Dumpster.</p>
        <p>Damn it, Robin, this is all I have left in the world--</p>
        <p>eight pot lids and a sword.</p>
        <p>Yeah, about the sword.</p>
        <p>Hello.</p>
        <p>Put on the suit, Mr. Mosby.</p>
        <p>Barney, I know it's you. Where's my stuff?</p>
        <p>It's not me.</p>
        <p>If you want to see your precious possessions again, put on the suit.</p>
        <p>What suit?</p>
        <p>Ding-dong. Oh, what's that? The doorbell.</p>
        <p>That's the suit I'm talking about.</p>
        <p>I haven't gotten to the door yet.</p>
        <p>Oh, okay, let me know when you get there.</p>
        <p>Okay, I opened it. And there's a suit there.</p>
        <p>That's the suit I'm talking about.</p>
        <p>Barney....</p>
        <p>This isn't Barney.</p>
        <p>But I hear that guy's awesome.</p>
        <p>All right. Listen very carefully.</p>
        <p>You will get your stuff back if you are able to complete a series of challenges.</p>
        <p>Number one, put on the suit.</p>
        <p>Number two, meet me at McClaren's in an hour.</p>
        <p>How will I know who to look for since we've never met?</p>
        <p>I look like Barney.</p>
        <p>Oh, hey, Ted.</p>
        <p>Suit and sneakers.</p>
        <p>A little Ellen DeGeneres but you pull it off.</p>
        <p>I don't have any other shoes because you stole them along with everything else I own in the world.</p>
        <p>Where's the truck, Barney?</p>
        <p>Barney.</p>
        <p>People's whose trucks I'm not holding for ransom call me Barney.</p>
        <p>I think you should call me The Commodore.</p>
        <p>I'm not calling you...</p>
        <p>You're not getting your stuff back.</p>
        <p>Can I please have my stuff back...</p>
        <p>The Commodore?</p>
        <p>No.</p>
        <p>Here's the deal, Ted, you're my bro.</p>
        <p>And you're about to become a henpecked, beaten down, shell of a man.</p>
        <p>So tonight, we are going to have one last awesome night together as bros.</p>
        <p>It's a bro-ing away party.</p>
        <p>A special bro-casion.</p>
        <p>A bro-choice rally.</p>
        <p>Bro-time at the Apollo.</p>
        <p>Oh, bro me.</p>
        <p>Well, so what do I have to do?</p>
        <p>No, it's not what you have to do, it's what you want to do, and you want to have a good time before you go take Fun Ted out back and shoot him.</p>
        <p>So... first thing on the docket... get me that girl's number.</p>
        <p>Absolutely not.</p>
        <p>Mm. That's too bad.</p>
        <p>Hey, hypothetical question: if I was all your stuff, would I rather be at the bottom of the East River or The Hudson?</p>
        <p>Hey, look, world's strongest man is on.</p>
        <p>Ooh, it's the one where Lou Ferrigno pulls the bus from the Partridge family with his teeth.</p>
        <p>It's the best one. Hey, Ted, get in...</p>
        <p>We live alone.</p>
        <p>Yay.</p>
        <p>Well, I win.</p>

        <p>You need to give my friend your phone number.</p>
        <p>Wow, I really didn't think Lou Ferrigno could pull that bus.</p>
        <p>Are you sure this is live? It looks pretty old.</p>
        <p>Yeah, that's 'cause the, uh, TV is old.</p>
        <p>So, I'll, uh, call you tomorrow?</p>
        <p>Yeah. Um, not too early. I have church.</p>
        <p>You were impressive, buddy.</p>
        <p>Nice work. All right, next challenge.</p>
        <p>No. No next challenge. Look, this is my first night living with Robin.</p>
        <p>She's probably pissed I'm spending it out with you.</p>
        <p>This might be our last hurrah, my little friend.</p>
        <p>Marshall, I am gonna cook you the best dinner of your life.</p>
        <p>How would you like a... one-egg omelet with some ketchup and film?</p>
        <p>Guess Ted's the one who did the shopping.</p>
        <p>Ooh, look, a microwave pizza!</p>
        <p>Guess the microwave was Ted's, too.</p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>So were all the towels.</p>
        <p>Turns out that everything that was useful in this apartment was Ted's.</p>
        <p>Everything that was a Foghat poster we bought ironically in college was mine.</p>
        <p>Marshall.</p>
        <p>Yeah, baby?</p>
        <p>I miss Ted.</p>
        <p>Is it too soon to call him?</p>
        <p>No, we shouldn't.</p>
        <p>I don't want to interrupt his first night living with Robin.</p>
        <p>Ha, nice shooting.</p>
        <p>You know, if we win this one it's free onion rings at the Intergalactic Snack Shack.</p>
        <p>What a bargain.</p>
        <p>We only had to spend 20 bucks a game.</p>
        <p>Admit it, you're having fun.</p>
        <p>Maybe.</p>
        <p>I mean, it was pretty funny when that little girl fell over that space barrel.</p>
        <p>Nice... We win.</p>
        <p>Oh, walk of shame, walk of game--</p>
        <p>what up?</p>
        <p>Okay. Let's go one more.</p>
        <p>I don't know.</p>
        <p>You know you want to.</p>
        <p>All right, let's do it... I just got to call Robin real quick.</p>
        <p>Oh, so that's what it's gonna be like from now on?</p>
        <p>No. Okay, okay. You call your old lady and ask permission to have fun.</p>
        <p>Me, I will be at the Snack Shack eating our victory onion rings Han style.</p>
        <p>Solo.</p>
        <p>Hey, Ted.</p>
        <p>Hey, sweetie listen, I'm really sorry but I'm gonna be pretty late, so don't wait up.</p>
        <p>Oh, it's totally fine. You do what you got to do.</p>
        <p>Thanks. You're the best. I love you.</p>
        <p>I love you, too. Bye.</p>
        <p>Hey, sorry about that. Thanks for holding.</p>
        <p>Um, so if you could go ahead and cancel my subscription to Guns and Ammo, that would be great.</p>
        <p>No, it's a great magazine. Really great.</p>
        <p>They've printed three of my letters.</p>
        <p>It's just that my boyfriend is moving in and he kind of doesn't approve of the whole gun thing.</p>
        <p>A free hand grenade phone?</p>
        <p>You know what? Let me give you my work address.</p>
        <p>I did it, baby!</p>
        <p>I got beer. I got food.</p>
        <p>We don't need Ted anymore.</p>
        <p>I am the provider of this apartment now, and I have provided!</p>
        <p>&quot;Provode&quot;? Provided.</p>
        <p>Anyway, I got us everything we need.</p>
        <p>Could you toss me the toilet paper?</p>
        <p>Be right back, baby. Sit tight.</p>
        <p>Hey, I got to admit, um... I didn't think I would, but, uh...</p>
        <p>I had a really good time tonight.</p>
        <p>You're a good friend, Barney.</p>
        <p>Hey, man, why don't you, uh... why don't you tell me where my truck is.</p>
        <p>No, I don't think so.</p>
        <p>Where's my truck?!</p>
        <p>Do you know why I haven't given you any of your possessions back yet?</p>
        <p>Uh, because you're Admiral Jerk of the British Royal Douchery?</p>
        <p>Because you don't want them back.</p>
        <p>You could've left at any time tonight, but you didn't, Ted.</p>
        <p>Why is that?</p>
        <p>Because I didn't want to go back to Robin's without my stuff.</p>
        <p>False. You know what I think?</p>
        <p>I think you spent one day with her and it already sucked.</p>
        <p>I think you didn't like being there, she didn't like having you there and you both realized that you made a huge mistake.</p>
        <p>And that's why you spent your first night living with Robin out playing laser tag with me.</p>
        <p>And that's why three seconds ago you didn't call it &quot;my place&quot; or &quot;our place&quot; or &quot;home,&quot; you called it &quot;Robin's.&quot;</p>
        <p>You know what?</p>
        <p>You can keep my stuff.</p>
        <p>Hey.</p>
        <p>Hey, did you get the truck back?</p>
        <p>No.</p>
        <p>Why not? What happened?</p>
        <p>Oh, he pissed me off so much, I left.</p>
        <p>Anyway, I just wanted to come back here, space out and watch a movie.</p>
        <p>Do you anything that wasn't made by John Woo?</p>
        <p>Why, do you?</p>
        <p>You know, forget the movie. I just want to sit.</p>
        <p>What?</p>
        <p>It's just I eat at that table.</p>
        <p>Fine, I'll take my shoes off.</p>
        <p>You know, why don't you just throw me down in the storage space where you have room for me.</p>
        <p>Ted, come on.</p>
        <p>No, you come on.</p>
        <p>I had to jump through hoops all night for Barney and then it took me an hour to get home because his place is so far away from the bar.</p>
        <p>Oh, my God.</p>
        <p>What?</p>
        <p>I know where Barney put my truck.</p>
        <p>Let's go back to my place.</p>
        <p>I bet you my place is closer.</p>
        <p>Here we are.</p>
        <p>You live in the loading dock behind the bar?</p>
        <p>I don't live here, baby. This is just my ride.</p>
        <p>No, no, no, no. I'm not getting into any van, I've seen Silence of the Lambs.</p>
        <p>Oh, my God. We're drinking champagne in the back of a moving van.</p>
        <p>Why, yes, Sara. Yes, we are.</p>
        <p>Those other Rockettes who called you slow are crazy.</p>
        <p>Oh, my God. I knew it. You're kidnapping me.</p>
        <p>Help! Help!</p>
        <p>No, no, no, no.</p>
        <p>I can explain.</p>
        <p>Hello?</p>
        <p>Enjoying the ride?</p>
        <p>Ted? Ted, you let us out of here. You let us out of here this instant!</p>
        <p>This isn't Ted.</p>
        <p>But I hear that guy's awesome.</p>
        <p>So I took Sara home and I took Barney to a bar near his apartment.</p>
        <p>Apparently, that strategy had never occurred to him.</p>
        <p>That poor girl must've been so confused.</p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>Well, at least Barney learned a valuable lesson.</p>
        <p>You do not want to get scissor kicked in the groin by a Rockette.</p>
        <p>So, uh, I guess we should get you unpacked.</p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>Yeah, I guess we should.</p>
        <p>Lily... deep within the Amazonian rainforest, there is a type of tree that only grows around the body of an existing tree.</p>
        <p>It cannot survive without this tree.</p>
        <p>It is supported... by this tree.</p>
        <p>Lily, we are that tree.</p>
        <p>The inside tree or the outside tree?</p>
        <p>The outside tree.</p>
        <p>Shouldn't there be three trees?</p>
        <p>You and I are one tree.</p>
        <p>Okay, look, Lily, the point is that we grew around Ted and without him, we're slowly dying.</p>
        <p>What do we do?</p>
        <p>I think we can marry each other.</p>
        <p>But we also have to marry Ted.</p>
        <p>I'll tell you right now, my Dad is not gonna pay for that wedding.</p>
        <p>Ted!</p>
        <p>What are you doing here?</p>
        <p>Robin and I aren't gonna move in together after all.</p>
        <p>What happened?</p>
        <p>I thought we decided we were ready?</p>
        <p>I know.</p>
        <p>How did we come to that again?</p>
        <p>I don't remember. We were fighting?</p>
        <p>It's all so blurry.</p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>The &quot;let's move in together&quot; s*x was pretty amazing.</p>
        <p>I know.</p>
        <p>I did that thing with no hands I normally need both to do.</p>
        <p>You know... I'm really happy with you.</p>
        <p>I really happy with you. The way things are.</p>
        <p>Maybe we shouldn't mess with that.</p>
        <p>I don't know that we should.</p>
        <p>Hey... I hear the &quot;let's not move in together&quot; s*x is pretty incredible.</p>
        <p>Let's go back to my place.</p>
        <p>Ooh, thank you.</p>
        <p>You're welcome.</p>
        <p>No, thank you.</p>
        <p>You'll be very happy.</p>
        <p>Look, I know you guys are really excited about having the place to yourself.</p>
        <p>Until after the wedding, I mean, if it's not too much of an imposition...</p>
        <p>God, this feels so right.</p>
        <p>Never leave us again.</p>
        <p>Guys, Robin's down in the truck and there's actually a lot of boxes, so maybe we should...</p>
        <p>Do we have time for this?</p>
        <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I have in my hand a copy of tonight's Top Ten list.</p>
        <p>The category: top ten things I would've called my truck...</p>
        <p>It was never your truck.</p>
        <p>...if Ted hadn't been a jerk and given it back.</p>
        <p>It was a rental.</p>
        <p>Number ten, &quot;The Winne-Bango.&quot;</p>
        <p>Number nine, &quot;The Pick-Up Truck.&quot;</p>
        <p>Number eight, &quot;The Ford Explore Her.&quot;</p>
        <p>Number seven, &quot;The You Scream Truck.&quot;</p>
        <p>You Scream.</p>
        <p>Number six, &quot;Feels On Wheels.&quot; Hello!</p>
        <p>Number five, &quot;The Ride Her Truck.&quot;</p>
        <p>Number four, &quot;The 18-Squeeler.&quot;</p>
        <p>Number three, &quot;The Esca-Laid.&quot;</p>
        <p>Number two, &quot;The Slam-Boney.&quot; and... the number one thing I would've called my truck if Ted hadn't been a jerk and given it back...</p>
        <p>&quot;The '69 Chevy.&quot;</p>
        <p>Sorry.</p>
