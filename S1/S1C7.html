        <p>7 - Matchmaker</p>
        <p><strong><em>YEAR 2030</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>LIVING ROOM</em></strong></p>
<p>(Daughter and Son sitting on couch)</p>
<p>Future Ted: Kids, before I met your mother, when I was still out there searching, I learned something valuable, that love is not a science.</p>
<p>Daughter: Wow, that was a great story, Dad.</p>
<p>Son: We're gonna go watch TV.</p>
<p>(Daughter and Son get up and leave)</p>
<p>Future Ted: You see, sometimes in life, you just have to accept that certain things can't be explained. And that's kinda scary.</p>
<p>(Daughter and Son return to sit on couch)</p>
<p><strong><em>BAR</em></strong></p>
<p>(year 2005; Ted, Barney and Robin sitting around table; Lily and Marshall run in)</p>
<p>Marshall: Oh my God.</p>
<p>Lily: I know, I'm still shaking.</p>
<p>(Lily grabs Barney's drink and drinks from it)</p>
<p>Barney: What the? Haha, joke's on you, I have a cold.</p>
<p>Robin: Are you guys OK? Marshall (yelling over to bartender): Another round and back it up for me and Lily.</p>
<p>Ted: What happened?</p>
<p>Marshall: We saw something, up in the apartment.</p>
<p>Lily: Something bad.</p>
<p>(flashback to Lily and Marshall entering apartment while kissing)</p>
<p>Marshall: I don't know what it is, but margaritas make me sexy.</p>
<p>Lily: Oh, mucho sexy. You quiero Marshall.</p>
<p>(Marshall and Lily hug and kiss, Lily looks over and sees something and looks scared)</p>
<p>Lily: Oh my God.</p>
<p>(Lily and Marshall scream and run out of the apartment)</p>
<p>(cut back to present scene in bar)</p>
<p>Ted: What was it?</p>
<p>Marshall: Only the craziest, meanest looking mouse you've ever seen.</p>
<p>Lily: Mouse? Sweetie, that wasn't a mouse. That was a huge cockroach.</p>
<p>Marshall: Baby, it was a mouse. It had a whiskers.</p>
<p>Lily: But those things coming out of his head, those were antennae</p>
<p>Barney: Marshall ran away from a cockroach.</p>
<p>Marshall: It, it was a mouse.</p>
<p>Barney: Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man.</p>
<p>Robin: Ooh, my story's on. Ted, pay attention. Carl, turn it up.</p>
<p>(newscast on TV)</p>
<p>Robin: I'm here with Ellen Pierce, New York's premiere matchmaker. Ellen, your company, Love Solutions boasts a 100% success rate. What's your secret?</p>
<p>Ellen: Science. Everything in life can be broken down to ones and zeros, even love.</p>
<p>All I have to do is input the variables, run the algorithm, and presto manifesto, you have a soulmate, and it works. Just ask all of my happy couples. And these are just the attractive ones, I have more photos in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Robin: Love Solution's Ellen Pierce, a beacon of hope for New York city's lovelorn. Robin Scherbatsky...</p>
<p><strong><em>BAR</em></strong></p>
<p>Barney: Was that chick at the end really a client?</p>
<p>Robin: Yes.</p>
<p>Barney: We're signing up.</p>
<p>Ted: What?</p>
<p>Barney: Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot. That's a perfect cocktail. Shake well, then sleep with.</p>
<p>Ted: I'm not going to a matchmaker. That's like giving up. It's the man version of getting a cat.</p>
<p>Marshall: No, it wasn't a cockroach. It had fur and only mammals have fur.</p>
<p>Lily: It was a cockroach.</p>
<p>Marshall: Come on, Lily, the only way that that was a cockroach was if it was wearing the skin of a mouse it just killed.</p>
<p>Lily: Oh my God.</p>
<p>(Lily grabs Barney's drink as he's about to take a drink from it and drinks it herself)</p>
<p>Barney: Come on.</p>
<p><strong><em>APARTMENT</em></strong></p>
<p>(Ted sitting on couch reading magazine, Ted hears squeaking and tiny footstep noises, Barney barges into the apartment_</p>
<p>Barney: Ted, hurry, you gotta help me. My boat is sinking.</p>
<p>Ted: What?</p>
<p>Barney: My boat is sinking.</p>
<p>Ted: You have a boat?</p>
<p>Yes, I bought a boat last year at a police auction. I just got a call from a guy down at the marina that it's leaning starboard at a 45 degree angle. If I don't get there right now, it's gonna capsize. Now, come on!</p>
<p>(Ted and Barney run out of the apartment)</p>
<p><strong><em>OFFICE</em></strong></p>
<p>(Ted and Barney are filling out applications for Love Solutions)</p>
<p>Ted: Your boat is sinking. That was good.</p>
<p>Barney: Come on, Ted, this is an incredible opportunity. We'll meet our soulmates, nail 'em and never call them again. (chuckles)</p>
<p>(Ellen enters the office)</p>
<p>Ellen: All finished, gentlemen? Congratulations, you have just taken your very first step.</p>
<p>Barney: Gosh, thanks, Ellen. I sure hope this works. I'm so done with the single life, all the games, the meaningless s*x.</p>
<p>Ellen: You deserve more.</p>
<p>Barney: That is so true, Ellen. I really think I'm ready to stop being a me and start being a we.</p>
<p>Hey, is there anyway I can let it be known that I love cuddling?</p>
<p>(Ellen, Ted and Barney sit around desk)</p>
<p>Ellen: Oh, of course you can. That is so...</p>
<p>Barney: It's kinda hard to talk about with Ted here, but I just want someone who's not afraid to hold me at night when the tears come. Ellen, can you help me find her?</p>
<p>Ellen: Get out.</p>
<p>Barney: What?</p>
<p>Ellen: I get 15 guys like you every week. Jerks who just want to meet vulnerable women, nail 'em and never call them again.</p>
<p>Barney: Oh my God, people do that.</p>
<p>Ellen: You wanna do this the easy way or the hard way?</p>
<p>Barney: What's the hard way? Security roughs me up and tosses me out?</p>
<p>Ellen: That's the easy way. The hard way is that I stomp the crap out of you myself.</p>
<p>(Barney looks like he doesn't believe her, Ellen stands up quickly, Barney stands up to run away)</p>
<p>Barney: OK, Ted, let's go.</p>
<p>(Ted gets up to leave)</p>
<p>Ellen: Not you, you stay.</p>
<p>(Ted and Ellen sit back down)</p>
<p>Ellen: You're cute. You're an architect. Good career and you didn't use an obvious alias on your application like your friend, Jack Package.</p>
<p>Barney (through office door): It's pronounced 'Pa-kojj.'</p>
<p>Ellen: Get outta here!</p>
<p>(Barney runs away)</p>
<p>Ellen: You I can work with. You give me three days and I will find the woman you will marry.</p>
<p>Ted: Ah, no thanks. I don't need an algorithm to meet women. It's New York City. You know, plenty of fish in the sea.</p>
<p>Ellen: Plenty of fish in the sea. Yes, there's 9 million people in New York, 4.5 million women. Of course you wanna meet someone roughly your own age, let's say, plus minus 5 years. So if we take into account the most recent census data, that leaves us with 482,000. But, uh, wait</p>
<p>48% of those are already in relationships and then you have to eliminate half for intelligence, sense of humor and compatibility and then you have to take out the ex-girlfriends and the relatives and oh, we can't forget those lesbians and then that leaves us with 8 women.</p>
<p>Ted: That can't be right. Eight? Really, eight?</p>
<p>Ellen: There are 8 fish in that big, blue ocean, Ted. And if you feel confident that you can reel one into your boat without me, there's the door.</p>
<p>Ted: Do you take credit cards?</p>
<p><strong><em>BAR</em></strong></p>
<p>(Barney and Robin sitting at booth; Marshall and Lily walk in)</p>
<p>Lily: OK, it's back and this time we got a good look.</p>
<p>(Lily sits by Barney and takes his drink away from him and drinks it)</p>
<p>Barney: Hey, seriously, you have to stop doing that.</p>
<p>Marshall: It's bigger now. It's been feeding.</p>
<p>Lily: We were just upstairs watching TV.</p>
<p>(flashback to Lily and Marshall sitting in apartment on couch in front of TV)</p>
<p>Marshall: Ah gosh.</p>
<p>(Marshall and Lily see something on ground)</p>
<p>Lily: OK, let's do this.</p>
<p>(Lily grabs aerosol spray can, Marshall grabs large phone book, Lily sprays and Marshall throws phone book on it, Lily screams and Marshall holds her)</p>
<p>Marshall: Shh, shh, it's OK, it's over.</p>
<p>(phone book starts moving towards kitchen, Marshall and Lily run out of apartment)</p>
<p>(back to scene at bar)</p>
<p>Barney: So did you get a good look at it?</p>
<p>Lily: Yeah. It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton like a roach...</p>
<p>Marshall: But it has mouse-like characteristics. Grey-brown tufts of fur, a tail.</p>
<p>Robin: So which is it, a cockroach or a mouse?</p>
<p>Lily: It's a cockamouse.</p>
<p>Robin: What?</p>
<p>Lily: It's some sort of mutant combination of the two. It's as if a cockroach and a mouse...you know...</p>
<p>Barney: Hit the horizontal ten-legged interspecies cha-cha?</p>
<p>Robin: That's impossible. That simply can't happen.</p>
<p>Lily: Oh, but it can.</p>
<p>Marshall: And it has</p>
<p>Lily: And it's pissed.</p>
<p>(Lily and Marshall down shots)</p>
<p>(Ted walks into the bar)</p>
<p>Ted: Dude, is everything OK? You left the front door open.</p>
<p>Marshall: There was no time.</p>
<p>Robin: So Love Solutions, did you meet the love of your life?</p>
<p>Ted: She said it'd take three days. It's been five days. Should I be worried?</p>
<p>Lily: Oh, just play it cool. Don't Ted out about it.</p>
<p>Ted: Did you just use my name as a verb?</p>
<p>Barney: Oh, yeah, we do that behind your back. Ted-out: to overthink. Also see Ted-up. Ted-up: to overthink something with disastrous results. Sample sentence: Billy Tedded up when</p>
<p>Ted: OK, I get it. Don't worry, I'm not gonna ted anything up or out. I'll just give it a few more days.</p>
<p><strong><em>LOVE SOLUTIONS OFFICE</em></strong></p>
<p>(subtitled '20 minutes later,' Ted enters Ellen's office)</p>
<p>Ted: Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted.</p>
<p>Ellen: Ted, hi. I meant to call you. The computer is still crunching the numbers. Busy as a bee, that little computer.</p>
<p>Ted: You said it was gonna be three days.</p>
<p>Ellen: Did I?</p>
<p>Ted: Hm.</p>
<p>Ellen: Three days? Really?</p>
<p>Ted: Yeah. When someone says you're gonna meet the perfect woman in three days, you gotta put that in your datebook, so...</p>
<p>Ellen: How do I say this? This is gonna be really hard. Ted, there are absolutely no women out there for you. Phew, actually I got through that OK.</p>
<p>(return from commercial break)</p>
<p>Ted: There are no women for me out there? I thought you said there were 8.</p>
<p>Ellen: I know. There are supposed to be. I don't know where they are.</p>
<p>Ted: But, I'm an architect. And you said I'm cute. I'm a cute architect.</p>
<p>Ellen: How do you think I feel? I have a 100% success rate. It's my hook. I could probably find somebody for you if you were gay.</p>
<p>Ted: Well, I'm not.</p>
<p>Ellen: A little bi maybe?</p>
<p>Ted: No. You're messing with me, right?</p>
<p>Ellen: Come see for yourself.</p>
<p>(Ellen brings Ted over to her computer)</p>
<p>Ellen: I cannot set you up unless you have a compatibility rating of 7.0 or higher, and look, 5.4, 4.8, 5.6...</p>
<p>Ted: There's a 9.6 right there.</p>
<p>(Ted points to something on computer monitor)</p>
<p>Ellen: Don't touch the computer. Yes, Sarah O'Brien. I fixed her up six months ago. She would have been absolutely perfect for you.</p>
<p>Ted: What about the guy you set her up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?</p>
<p>Ellen: 8.5.</p>
<p>Ted: So he sucks.</p>
<p>Ellen: No, 8.5 is an extremely good match-up quotient.</p>
<p>Ted: Oh, sure, it's good. It's solid. But a 9.6?</p>
<p>Ellen: Yes, 9.6 is off the charts, but Sarah is matched up. Ted, look, I have a lunch. Please. I promise we will find you somebody. Don't lose hope. There are new women turning 18 every day.</p>
<p>(Ted and Ellen leave office, Ted sneaks back into office and goes to computer and takes printouts, hides them in his jacket and runs back out of office)</p>

<p><strong><em>BAR</em></strong></p>
<p>(Lily and Marshall giving presentation at bar, Marshall is drawing something on a little chalkboard)</p>
<p>Lily: He's a whole new species. The cockamouse.</p>
<p>Marshall: And it's the size of a potato.</p>
<p>(Marshall shows everyone his drawing of the cockamous)</p>
<p>Robin: So, what, now it's a cockapotatomouse?</p>
<p>Marshall: Don't make it sound ridiculous. It's a cockamouse.</p>
<p>(Barney and Ted are sitting at booth with Ted looking at printouts he took from Love Solutions)</p>
<p>Ted: My God, this is incredible. We're like the same person. Sarah O'Brien loves brunch.</p>
<p>She wants to have two children. Her guilty pleasure song is Summer Breeze by Seals and Croft.</p>
<p>Barney: Wow, Ted, sounds like you're her perfect woman.</p>
<p>Marshall: And like the majestic seahorse it's hermaphroditic.</p>
<p>Lily: Obviously the whole thing is shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>Marshall: For as much as we know about the cockamousse, there are still so much we don't know.</p>
<p>Robin: Well, we know that there's no such thing as a cockamouse. What we don't know is what you guys have been smoking.</p>
<p>Marshall: So you really don't believe in the cockamouse?</p>
<p>Robin: Well, I believe that you saw something perfectly normal but you've exaggerated it in your mind, you know, um, like the Loch Ness Monster.</p>
<p>Marshall: If by 'like the Loch Ness Monster,' you mean, totally exists and is awesome, then yeah, it's like the Loch Ness monster.</p>
<p>(Robin walks over to Ted and Barney)</p>
<p>Marshall: It's diet is not unlike our own, grains, cereals and it's awfully fond of cheese...</p>
<p>Ted: OK, this is getting weird, the similarities go on and on. She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies too. She's a dermatologist. I have skin.</p>
<p>Barney: You wanna be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend. It's uncanny.</p>
<p>Ted: All right, but it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right? See what my 9.6 looks like in person, as, you know, a frame of reference. And if she thinks she can do 11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?</p>
<p>Future Ted VO: That's right, I did the math.</p>
<p><strong><em>DOCTOR'S OFFICE</em></strong></p>
<p>(Ted waiting in examination room, doctor walks in)</p>
<p>Ted: Hi.</p>
<p>Sarah: Hi, I'm Dr. O'Brien.</p>
<p>Ted: I'm Architect Mosby. Sorry I just wanted to say my job too.</p>
<p>(Sarah laughs)</p>
<p>Ted: Hi, I'm Ted.</p>
<p>Sarah: So, what are we doing today?</p>
<p>Ted: I have a kind of mole on my back. It's probably nothing but I'm a cautious guy.</p>
<p>Sarah: I'm exactly the same.</p>
<p>Ted (singing): Summer breeze makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.</p>
<p>Sarah (joining in singing): Blowing through the jasmine in my mind.</p>
<p>Ted: Sorry about that, Summer Breeze is my guilty pleasure song.</p>
<p>Ted: Oh, it's been stuck in my head ever since I heard it this weekend at brunch.</p>
<p>Sarah: I love brunch.</p>
<p>Ted: It's the best, as long as I don't have to spend it with a bunch of phonies.</p>
<p>Sarah: I like the way you think, Architect Mosby.</p>
<p>Ted: Hey, this may sound weird but it'll definitely sound more weird once my shirt's off so I'm gonna ask you now. Do you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night?</p>
<p>Sarah: Oh, that's very sweet, but I'm actually getting married on Saturday.</p>
<p>Ted: Friday night?</p>
<p>(return from commercial break)</p>
<p>Ted: Wow, you're getting married. Congratulations.</p>
<p>Sarah: Thank you.</p>
<p>Ted: I'm really sorry I asked you out. If just felt like there might be this weird connection between us. How crazy am I coming off here?</p>
<p>Sarah: Only a little.</p>
<p>Ted: Well, by some million to one shot, and I'm not rooting for this, you wind up not getting married this weekend, give me a call.</p>
<p>Sarah: OK, but it's not likely. I look damn good in my dress.</p>
<p>Ted: I'm sure you do.</p>
<p><strong><em>APARTMENT</em></strong></p>
<p>(Lily and Marshall working on contraption in living room area, Robin walks in from kitchen)</p>
<p>Robin: Wow, that's a pretty sophisticated trap. You think the road runner's gonna fall for it?</p>
<p>Lily: OK, we get it. You're skeptical. But Marshall and I, we're believers. We believe.</p>
<p>Marshall: Yeah, look around. The universe is mysterious and awesome. You got the Bermuda triangle, ghosts, Big Foot.</p>
<p>Robin: Bad maps. Creaky houses. Hillbilly in a gorilla suit.</p>
<p>Marshall: Aliens.</p>
<p>(Robin shakes her head)</p>
<p>Marshall: Oh, come one, you gotta give me aliens. Stonehenge. Area 51. There's alien crap all over the place.</p>
<p>Robin: You can't be serious.</p>
<p>Marshall: My friend, you just poked the bear.</p>
<p>(Marshall walks toward his bedroom, Ted and Barney walk in through front door)</p>
<p>Ted: So, my 9.6, beautiful, charming, intelligent, engaged.</p>
<p>Robin: Oh.</p>
<p>Lily: Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>Ted: Yeah, it was a long shot. I told her to call me anyway if she changes her mine, but I don't know...</p>
<p>Lily: Whoa whoa whoa, let's not skip over this. Raise your hand if earlier today you hit on an engaged woman.</p>
<p>(Ted and Barney both raise their hands)</p>
<p>Barney: Come on, Lily, don't hate the player, hate the game.</p>
<p>(Marshall walks in from his bedroom reading from a book)</p>
<p>Marshall: On the night of July 2nd, 1947, conditions were clear over Roswell, New Mexico.</p>
<p>Robin: Oh geez.</p>
<p>Marshall: Oh, hey, Ted, there's a message on the machine for you. Dr. O'Brien.</p>
<p>Ted: What?</p>
<p>Marshall: When suddenly, an array of</p>
<p>(Ted jumps over to machine and shushes Marshall to listen to message)</p>
<p>Sarah (on answering machine): Ted, hi, this is Dr. O'Brien. About today, listen, I really need to talk to you. Call me, I'll be at the office all day.</p>
<p>Barney: The doctor will see you now.</p>
<p>(return from commercial break)</p>
<p>Ted: What should I do? I should totally go down there, right?</p>
<p>Lily: Don't interfere. Some guy is expecting to marry this woman on Saturday.</p>
<p>Ted: Yeah, an 8.5 guy. Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it, I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so.</p>
<p>In that scenario, I'm not interfering, I'm a happy ending.</p>
<p>Barney: (chuckles) Happy ending.</p>
<p>Ted: Look, I have to go down there. I don't know what's gonna happen when I get there but I have to give it a shot.</p>
<p>(Ted leaves apartment)</p>
<p>Barney: All right, see you later. Happy hunting.</p>
<p>(Barney and Robin get up to leave)</p>
<p>Lily: Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cockamouse.</p>
<p>Barney: Yeah, we're gonna make some crop circles.</p>
<p>(pot falls down from contraption)</p>
<p>Marshall: Oh my God!</p>
<p>Lily: Holy crap. We got it! What do we do with it?</p>
<p>Marshall: Calm down, I have a plan. I told my friend, Sudeep, about it. He wants to show it to the Columbia biology department. But it has to be alive.</p>
<p>Lily: Wait, no no. They'll do lab experiments on it. That's so mean. Shouldn't we just beat it to death with a bat?</p>
<p><strong><em>DOCTOR'S OFFICE</em></strong></p>
<p>(Ted enters Dr. O'Brien's office)</p>
<p>Ted: Hello again.</p>
<p>Sarah: I'm glad you came down. I would prefer to say this to you in person.</p>
<p>Ted: Go ahead, Sarah, you can tell me anything.</p>
<p>Sarah: You have a basal cell carcinoma.</p>
<p>Ted: Anything else?</p>
<p>Sarah: Your mole. The biopsy came back. It's not life-threatening, but we should excise the rest of it.</p>
<p>Ted: Wait, then you're still getting married.</p>
<p>Sarah: Of course I'm still getting married.</p>
<p>Ted: But we're a 9.6.</p>
<p>Sarah: Excuse me.</p>
<p>Ted: OK, I, I went to Love Solutions and I saw on Ellen Pierce's computer that you and I are a 9.6. Your fiance's only an 8.5.</p>
<p>Sarah: You looked at my file.</p>
<p>Ted: I had to. You're my only match. Aren't you even a little curious? The woman who set you up with your fiancé thinks we're a better match.</p>
<p>Sarah: I am getting married on Saturday.</p>
<p>Ted (singing): Summer breeze...</p>
<p>Sarah: Ted.</p>
<p>Ted: Look, don't you think you're being a little impulsive marrying a guy you just met a few months ago?</p>
<p>Sarah: Don't you think it's a little impulsive for you to proposition an engaged woman you don't even know?</p>
<p>Ted: See, we're both impulsive. We're perfect for each other.</p>
<p>Sarah: Ted, just calm down.</p>
<p>Ted: Calm down! You're my only match! There was a computer and there were 8 fish in the sea full of lesbians.</p>
<p>Sarah: Ted, Ted, do you honestly believe deep down that there is no one else out there for you just because some computer says so.</p>
<p>Ted: Didn't used to. There was math, I got confused.</p>
<p>Sarah: Love isn't a science. You can't calculate a feeling. When you fall in love with someone, 8.5 equals a perfect 10.</p>
<p>Ted: You're right.</p>
<p><strong><em>LAB</em></strong></p>
<p>(Marshall bring Sudeep cockamouse in pot)</p>
<p>Sudeep: If this thing is what you say it is, it could be huge for my career.</p>
<p>Marshall: Brace yourself, dude. This is gonna blow your mind hold.</p>
<p>(Sudeep moves cover to peek into pot)</p>
<p>Sudeep: You b*st*rd, I actually got excited about this.</p>
<p>Marshall: What?</p>
<p>Sudeep: It's empty.</p>
<p>(Sudeep removes cover of pot completely and Marshall looks in)</p>
<p>Marshall: Wait, but if it's not here, that means...Lily.</p>
<p><strong><em>APARTMENT</em></strong></p>
<p>(Robin sits on couch, Lily walks into living room area but backs away and hides)</p>
<p>Lily: Robin.</p>
<p>Robin: What?</p>
<p>(Robin walks over to Lily and sees what she sees)</p>
<p>Robin: Oh my God. It's real.</p>
<p>Lily: Oh, is it? Do something.</p>
<p>(Robin throws drink at it)</p>
<p>Lily: What the hell was that? You trying to get it drunk?</p>
<p>Robin: It was the only think I could think of.</p>
<p>(Marshall runs into apartment)</p>
<p>Marshall: Lily thank God.</p>
<p>(Lily points over to cockamouse)</p>
<p>Marshall: Lily, I love you.</p>
<p>(Marshall grabs cockamouse and run towards window)</p>
<p>Marshall: Robin, open the window!</p>
<p>(Lily, Marshall and Robin run over to window and Robin tries to open window, Marshall throws cockamouse out the window)</p>
<p>Robin: It can fly.</p>
<p>Lily, Marshall: Wow.</p>
<p>Marshall: Be free, mutant beast. I'll miss this private war of ours. I grew to admire your tenacious...Oh my God, it's headed this way.</p>
<p>(Marshall slams window shut and animal flies into it)</p>
<p><strong><em>LOVE SOLUTIONS OFFICE</em></strong></p>
<p>(Ellen sits alone in the dark, Ted enters office)</p>
<p>Ted: Hi Ellen. I think I want my money back.</p>
<p>Ellen: I'm a failure. I'm all washed up. I tried everything, Ted. I widened the search parameters. I tweaked the program. Last night, I stood out on the street for five hours showing your photo to random pedestrians, no takers. Although this transvestite hooker said he/she would do you for half price because you kinda look like John Cusack and his/her favorite movie was Say Anything.</p>
<p>Ted: Come on, Ellen, I mean, a pint of ice cream isn't that a bit cliché?</p>
<p>Ellen: It's for the bourbon.</p>
<p>Ted: This isn't hopeless. You're gonna find someone for me.</p>
<p>Ellen: No, I won't. You're gonna die alone.</p>
<p>Ted: I'm not gonna die alone. Look at me. I'm bright, I'm attractive. You just have to get back out there and keep looking.</p>
<p>Ellen: No, you're never gonna find anybody. And every year, you're just getting older and it's getting harder and harder.</p>
<p>Ted: You're being ridiculous. I'm gonna be up on that wall one of these days.</p>
<p>Ellen: No you won't.</p>
<p>Ted: Yes I will</p>
<p>Ellen: How do you know? Ted: I don't know, but I believe. Hell, if a cockroach and a mouse can find love in this crazy city, then, dammit, so can I.</p>
<p>Ellen: You're losing me.</p>
<p>Ted: Point is, something good is going to happen to me. Maybe your computer will help, maybe it won't, but it'll happen.</p>
<p>Ellen: So I should keep looking?</p>
<p>Ted: Of course you should. And now you're gonna do it for free.</p>
