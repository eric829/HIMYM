        <p>20 - Miracles</p>
        <p><em> of the cab ride that changed my life.</p>
          <p>I know it sounds crazy, but for all I know my life would be very different if I had taken, say... that cab.</p>
          <p>Or that cab.</p>
          <p>God knows what would have happened if I had gotten into that cab.</p>
          <p>I took this cab.</p>
          <p>And it changed my whole life.</p>
          <p>But first, we need to back up a little.</em></p>
          <p>Hey.</p>
          <p>Is there any beer in the fridge?</p>
          <p>It's 10:00 in the morning.</p>
          <p>Grab me one.</p>
          <p>So, something bad just happened.</p>
          <p>Stella and I were out having breakfast.</p>
          <p>So, my sister broke up with her boyfriend.</p>
          <p>Well, I can finally say it.</p>
          <p>I hated that guy!</p>
          <p>Everything out of his mouth is, &quot;I'm a vegan. &quot;Fish feel pain.</p>
          <p>I'm never constipated. &quot;</p>
          <p>The guy's an idiot.</p>
          <p>Actually, she's marrying him.</p>
          <p>I just wanted your honest opinion.</p>
          <p>He's actually a really nice guy.</p>
          <p>I think there's a wisdom to...</p>
          <p>Anyway, they picked a date, so, uh, you want to come with me, so that we can laugh our asses off as we watch him walk barefoot down the aisle in a hemp tuxedo?</p>
          <p>Yeah, sure. When is it?</p>
          <p>Uh, first weekend in November.</p>
          <p>Is that </p>
          <p>the something bad?</p>
          <p>That she invited you to a wedding?</p>
          <p>Six months from now.</p>
          <p>As in we'll be together six months from now.</p>
          <p>Do you guys remember Barney's whole thing about making plans in a relationship?</p>
          <p>Fourth row.</p>
          <p>Ted, no.</p>
          <p>You're violating the date-time continuum.</p>
          <p>You never make plans with a girl further in the future than the amount of time you've been going out.</p>
          <p>You've been dating this girl for, what, two weeks?</p>
          <p>No, you're not taking her to a Springsteen concert in January.</p>
          <p>By that time you won't even remember this Robin girl's name.</p>
          <p>Ugh, man, I love Springsteen!</p>
          <p>He's like the American Bryan Adams.</p>
          <p>Well...</p>
          <p>But Barney had a point.</p>
          <p>As soon as she started talking about the wedding, it freaked me out.</p>
          <p>Oh, that sounds like so much fun.</p>
          <p>Mmm. So I get to look forward to it for six months.</p>
          <p>Which is twice as long as we've been dating.</p>
          <p>Uh-oh.</p>
          <p>I'm sure your daughter Lucy'll come so it'll be like a... a family trip.</p>
          <p>Our first trip as our funny little family.</p>
          <p>So that... that'll be super-exciting.</p>
          <p>Oh, boy.</p>
          <p>Man, they crank up the heat in these places.</p>
          <p>What's going on, Ted?</p>
          <p>We need to talk.</p>
          <p>Oh. Oh. Oh. &quot;We need to talk&quot;?</p>
          <p>There's only two situations where you say that to someone and unless you're pregnant, it sounds like you broke up with her.</p>
          <p>Yeah, I did.</p>
          <p>So how did she take it?</p>
          <p>Um...</p>
          <p>I'm only trying to be honest with you.</p>
          <p>You know, Ted. I have to go to work.</p>
          <p>Stella, can we just...</p>
          <p>I d't want to leave it like this.</p>
          <p>No, Ted, it's okay.</p>
          <p>We're good.</p>
          <p>Ow!</p>
          <p>Look, I know it sounds rough, but Stella's a mom.</p>
          <p>I have to be responsible.</p>
          <p>If I'm having these feelings now, what if they don't go away?</p>
          <p>What if they just get worse and worse d six months from now, I break up with her over tofu salmon at her sister's wedding?</p>
          <p>I can't do that to her.</p>
          <p>And I definitely can't do that to her daughter.</p>
          <p>It sucks, but I'm being the good guy here.</p>
          <p>This is the right decision.</p>
          <p><em>Which brings me back to the cab ride.</em></p>
          <p>Hello, may I speak with Marshall Eriksen?</p>
          <p>Hey, guys.</p>
          <p>Jell-O?</p>
          <p>How I Met Your Mother Jimmy</p>
          <p>can't believe this. So you're totally fine.</p>
          <p>No, I'm not fine.</p>
          <p>I made the biggest mistake of my life.</p>
          <p>I want Stella back.</p>
          <p>I've left her like ten messages, but her phone's off.</p>
          <p>She's at that arcade Kiddie Funland with her daughter.</p>
          <p>Please.</p>
          <p>Let me go to Kiddie Funland.</p>
          <p>You can say that all you want, buddy, but you're not getting any morphine.</p>
          <p>No, I'm serious. I got to get out of here.</p>
          <p>You're not going anywhere until we get the tests back.</p>
          <p>You could have internal bleeding.</p>
          <p>Your brain could be all full of blood.</p>
          <p>Think that's good for it? ain't.</p>
          <p>This sucks.</p>
          <p>This sucks. This sucks. Are you... are you kidding me?</p>
          <p>You walked away from a car accident without a scratch.</p>
          <p>A miracle took place today.</p>
          <p>Oh, here we go.</p>
          <p>You don't think this was a miracle?</p>
          <p>There's no such thing as miracles.</p>
          <p>March 2006, MacLaren's Bar.</p>
          <p>Oh.</p>
          <p>That's terrible. Gentle.</p>
          <p>That's in! Gentle.</p>
          <p>Ow. Here we go.</p>
          <p>Hey!</p>
          <p>Bravo.</p>
          <p>Cheers...</p>
          <p>Mm-hmm.</p>
          <p>No... way.</p>
          <p>That did not just happen.</p>
          <p>Am I dead?</p>
          <p>Miracle!</p>
          <p>A pencil went up Barney's nose, and you call it a miracle.</p>
          <p>Well, do you have a better explanation for it?</p>
          <p>A drunk jackass with a box of pencils?</p>
          <p>A drunk jackass called &quot;God!&quot;</p>
          <p>And a box of pencils called &quot;destiny!&quot;</p>
          <p>Speaking of Barney, I should give him a call.</p>
          <p>Why? We're not friends anymore.</p>
          <p>You'd want to know if thisappened to him.</p>
          <p>Go for Barney.</p>
          <p>Hey, Barney.</p>
          <p>Listen, I have something to tell you.</p>
          <p>Oh, boy, here we go.</p>
          <p>I've been waiting for this one.</p>
          <p>You talked to Robin.</p>
          <p>She told you what's under the hood and you want to take it for a spin yourself.</p>
          <p>Not even if you boiled it in detergent.</p>
          <p>It's about Ted.</p>
          <p>Ted?</p>
          <p>My former best friend Ted who I asked you never to mention to me again?</p>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
          <p>He's been in a car accident.</p>
          <p>He's at Saint Anthony's hospital.</p>
          <p>Everything's...</p>
          <p>No, I understand.</p>
          <p>You've got that important thing.</p>
          <p>Okay.</p>
          <p>Oh, of course I'll tell him you love him.</p>
          <p>Okay.</p>
          <p>Suit up!</p>
          <p>He is always saying stuff like that!</p>
          <p>He hung up, didn't he? Yeah.</p>
          <p>See, I told you. We're not friends anymore.</p>
          <p>♪♪♪♪♪♪</p>
          <p>What did he say?</p>
          <p>Ah, a hundred and thir... What?</p>
          <p>You...</p>
          <p>I'm coming, Ted.</p>
          <p>So, what made you change your mind about Stella?</p>
          <p>Well, I was in the cab, and the car was coming at me, <em>and you know how they say that your whole life flashes before your eyes in a near-death experience?</p>
          <p>It doesn't.</p>
          <p>You don't see everything.</p>
          <p>Just the things you love.</em></p>
          <p>I realized in that moment that Stella is the most important thing in my life and-and I have to get her back.</p>
          <p>Aw!</p>
          <p>Miracle!</p>
          <p>Very sweet.</p>
          <p>Very romantic.</p>
          <p>Not a miracle.</p>
          <p>July 1999.</p>
          <p>Kennedy Airport.</p>
          <p>So, did you enjoy...</p>
          <p>Amsterdam?</p>
          <p>No.</p>
          <p>Nothing illegal.</p>
          <p>Paintings.</p>
          <p>All right, Bob Marley.</p>
          <p>Let's have a conversation.</p>
          <p>Shift change.</p>
          <p>Oh, Amsterdam.</p>
          <p>All right.</p>
          <p>Float on through, brother.</p>
          <p>Miracle!</p>
          <p>Don't you go into the light!</p>
          <p>Don't you do it!</p>
          <p>Hey, Mosby, you got a visitor.</p>
          <p>Hey, guys.</p>
          <p>Hey. Hey. Hey.</p>
          <p>Can you guys, uh, give us a minute?</p>
          <p>Stella, before you say anytng...</p>
          <p>I love you.</p>
          <p>I love you, too.</p>
          <p>Can we just forget about...</p>
          <p>It's forgotten.</p>
          <p>Is this your chart?</p>
          <p>Okay.</p>
          <p>Uh-huh.</p>
          <p>Everything looks good.</p>
          <p>I think you can handle it.</p>
          <p>Handle what?</p>
          <p>Aww! Aww! Aww!</p>
          <p>This morning he dumped her and now she's dry-humping him on a hospital bed.</p>
          <p>Miracle! Yeah, you know, I bet if you call up the Vatican, they will tell you that most of their certified miracles involve dry-humping, so.</p>
          <p>April 2008.</p>
          <p>Lily's kindergarten classroom.</p>
          <p>You're gonna go in there and beg for your old job back?</p>
          <p>That's crazy.</p>
          <p>You hated it there.</p>
          <p>I- I know, the job market is just really bad right now.</p>
          <p>Hey, kids, who wants Uncle Marshall to get his old job back?</p>
          <p>They'll cheer for anything if you say it like that.</p>
          <p>Kids, a super tanker spilled five million gallons of oil off the coast of Alaska this morning!</p>
          <p><em>Hello, Marshall.</em></p>
          <p>Mr. Hewitt, I came here to apologize.</p>
          <p>I'm going to go grab some more glue.</p>
          <p>Will you watch them for a sec?</p>
          <p>Of course.</p>
          <p>Leaving Nicholson, Hewitt, and West was a huge mistake, and I can see that now.</p>
          <p>So... who wants to see the big guy put on these tiny hats?</p>
          <p>My behavior was disrespectful.</p>
          <p>It was unprofessional.</p>
          <p>I'm a pilgrim.</p>
          <p>I know it looks like I have a tiny hat, but in reality, I have an abnormally large head!</p>
          <p>I was going through a stressful time.</p>
          <p>I wasn't getting enough sleep.</p>
          <p>Fourscore and seven years ago, I had a great, big giant head!</p>
          <p>I had just bought an apartment, and there were some problems.</p>
          <p>I- I don't want to bore you with the details.</p>
          <p>I only regret that I have but one giant head to give for my country.</p>

          <p>Sir, if you could just see your way into giving me one more chance, I promise... Marshall.</p>
          <p>I'm willing to give this a second chance.</p>
          <p>I remember my first years as an attorney.</p>
          <p>Why, I don't know how many hours I spent.</p>
          <p>I don't think I ever left...</p>
          <p><em>Oh, my God!</p>
          <p>I have lice.</p>
          <p>Those little bastards gave me lice.</p>
          <p>God, it itches.</p>
          <p>Don't scratch it.</p>
          <p>You'll look like a fool.</p>
          <p>You'll never get your job back.</p>
          <p>Okay, you can scratch, but just make it subtle.</p>
          <p>Okay, that's not working.</p>
          <p>, sweet, sharp corner of the desk, how I long to rub my infested scalp against you.</em></p>
          <p>I was, um... just, uh...</p>
          <p>You okay, Eriksen?</p>
          <p>Oh! Oh, yes, I'm good.</p>
          <p>I am good.</p>
          <p>Continue.</p>
          <p><em>Mind over matter.</p>
          <p>There are no lice in my hair... laying eggs, burrowing into my scalp, </em></p>
          <p>eating their way all the way down to my brain![/i]</p>
          <p>I have lice!</p>
          <p>&quot;Lice&quot;?! Lice! Get out!</p>
          <p>Get out of my office!</p>
          <p>We've got lice!</p>
          <p>Everybody out of the building.</p>
          <p>If it weren't for the lice, I would have gotten my job back, and I would have been working there when, </p>
          <p><em>two weeks later, the Securities and Exchange Commission came a-knocking.</em></p>
          <p>God sent those lice to my head like he sent the locusts to Egypt:</p>
          <p>to liberate me from corporate bondage.</p>
          <p>Miracle.</p>
          <p>Hey, guys.</p>
          <p>Oh, I'm just so glad you and Ted are back together. Yeah.</p>
          <p>Wait, um, what do you mean &quot;back together&quot;?</p>
          <p>Well, you know, since you guys broke up.</p>
          <p>What? Oh, no.</p>
          <p>It was just a small fight.</p>
          <p>That wasn't a breakup.</p>
          <p>Was that a breakup? Did he think that was a breakup?</p>
          <p>What?</p>
          <p>Son of a bitch!</p>
          <p>That was a breakup. Wasn't it?</p>
          <p>You broke up with me.</p>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
          <p>I didn't know that that was a breakup.</p>
          <p>Are you kidding?</p>
          <p>I- I said, &quot;I feel awful. &quot;</p>
          <p>You said, &quot;We're good. &quot;</p>
          <p>Then you got up and left.</p>
          <p>Yeah, I said, &quot;We're good, &quot; as in &quot;We're good. &quot;</p>
          <p>Like when the waiter comes around and asks if you want any more muffins, and you say, &quot;We're good. &quot;</p>
          <p>Exactly, and I took that &quot;We're good&quot; to mean you didn't want any more metaphorical relationship muffins.</p>
          <p>This is crazy.</p>
          <p>Forget about all that.</p>
          <p>That was a whole life-changing car accident ago.</p>
          <p>I love you.</p>
          <p>I don't want to break up.</p>
          <p>But you did.</p>
          <p>You did want to.</p>
          <p>And if you had those feelings once, then you're going to have those feelings again, and you're going to keep on having them.</p>
          <p>And I can't count on that car to hit you every time you do.</p>
          <p>What are you saying?</p>
          <p>I'm saying... you wanted your breakup, you got it.</p>
          <p>What?! Stella, wait!</p>
          <p>No, you know what, Ted?</p>
          <p>???</p>
          <p>So you broke up with her and she didn't know it?</p>
          <p>Apparently.</p>
          <p>And you actually said, &quot;I want to break up&quot;?</p>
          <p>No, of course not.</p>
          <p>Who says &quot;I want to break up&quot;?</p>
          <p>That's a horrible thing to say.</p>
          <p>Well, that's true.</p>
          <p>Hello?</p>
          <p>Hi, Ted Mosby? We have you listed as the emergency contact for Barney Stinson.</p>
          <p>What is it?</p>
          <p><em>What it was was this.</em></p>
          <p>I made it. I made it!</p>
          <p>Dude, I...</p>
          <p>I can't believe you ran all the way up here.</p>
          <p>Jeez. Flatter yourself much?</p>
          <p>What an ego on this guy.</p>
          <p>Um, I was up in this part of town because I had to attend a very important international business meeting.</p>
          <p>If you're here to come crawling back, just save it.</p>
          <p>I'm doing awesome without you.</p>
          <p>Even br now, 'cause I can play the sympathy card with the females.</p>
          <p>And BTW, there's one bone downstairs that ain't broken.</p>
          <p>Marshall, you know what I'm talking about.</p>
          <p>Up top!</p>
          <p>Hup!</p>
          <p>Are you sure?</p>
          <p>Yeah, dude. Why do y think I had them set it this way?</p>
          <p>Okay.</p>
          <p>Ow!</p>
          <p>Worth it.</p>
          <p>Barney, you, uh...</p>
          <p>Yocould've died.</p>
          <p>Ted, I'm sorry I broke the bro code.</p>
          <p>No, I'm-I'm sorry.</p>
          <p>Ted, can we be friends again?</p>
          <p>Barney, come on, we're... we're more than friends.</p>
          <p>We're brothers.</p>
          <p>You're my brother, Ted. You're my brother, Barney.</p>
          <p>Did you hear that, Marshall?</p>
          <p>We're brothers now.</p>
          <p>Marshall's my brother, too.</p>
          <p>We're all brothers.</p>
          <p>Yeah, but I'm your best brother, right?</p>
          <p><em>And that's how your Uncle Barney and I buried the hatchet.</p>
          <p>It got pretty mushy and embarrassing after that.</p>
          <p>Let's skip ahead.</em></p>
          <p>I had to look away because if I watched what the paramedics were about to do, I would have passed out.</p>
          <p>Then they took out this electric blade thing and I kept thinking, &quot;This isn't happening. This isn't happening. &quot;</p>
          <p>Oh, my God. What did they cut?</p>
          <p>My suit.</p>
          <p>My beautiful suit.</p>
          <p>But you're alive, and, and Ted's alive.</p>
          <p>This is amazing!</p>
          <p>Two miracles in one day.</p>
          <p>What is the matter with you?</p>
          <p>How can you possibly be this cynical?!</p>
          <p>You want to know? Yeah.</p>
          <p>You really want to know? Yeah!</p>
          <p>Fine.</p>
          <p>When I was a kid, I had this dog, Sir Scratchawan.</p>
          <p>Anyway, Sir Scratchawan got really old, so my parents decided to put him down.</p>
          <p><em>It was the toughest day of my young life.</em></p>
          <p>Good-byI love you.</p>
          <p>And when they took him to the vet, he told them that earlier that very day, he had learned about an experimental procedure called a canine/testudine cerebro-xenograft.</p>
          <p>Ever heard of it?</p>
          <p>No.</p>
          <p>Well, it saved Sir Scratchawan's life.</p>
          <p>He lived another seven years.</p>
          <p>Miracle. Except for one... kind of big side effect from the surgery.</p>
          <p>SiScratchawan!</p>
          <p>Welcome home!</p>
          <p>He turned into a turtle.</p>
          <p>I know. It's weird, right?</p>
          <p>Apparently, a very common complication from canine/testudine cerebro-xenografts.</p>
          <p>And he didn't seem to remember any of his old tricks.</p>
          <p>Go get it, Scratchy.</p>
          <p>Go get it!</p>
          <p>Go get it! Get it!</p>
          <p>Go get it, Scratchy.</p>
          <p>Go get it.</p>
          <p>How long was it before...?</p>
          <p>Longer than I'm proud of, Lily.</p>
          <p>Longer than I'm proud of.</p>
          <p>And that's when I realized miracles ain't real.</p>
          <p>Excuse me.</p>
          <p>Mosby, you're still here?</p>
          <p>Your tests came back, like, an hour ago. You're fine.</p>
          <p>Are you kidding me? Why didn't you tell me?!</p>
          <p>I'm sorry.</p>
          <p>I guess it was rude of me to keep resuscitating that guy with a rake sticking out of his chest.</p>
          <p>Um, I have to go right now. Barney, I...</p>
          <p>Go.</p>
          <p>Run, Ted. Run.</p>
          <p>If there's anything I've taught you over the years, it's...</p>
          <p>Barney, he left. Oh.</p>
          <p>Hey, Ted said that right before the accident, his life flashed before his eyes.</p>
          <p>You know, all the stuff he loves.</p>
          <p>Did that happen to you? Oh, yeah.</p>
          <p>I know what he saw: boobs. Scotch.</p>
          <p>And money.</p>
          <p>Suits. A suit of money.</p>
          <p>A suit of boobs.</p>
          <p>A giant boob wearing a suit of money.</p>
          <p>And the boob is lactating scotch.</p>
          <p>I guess that's pretty much everything you love, right?</p>
          <p>Yeah, pretty much.</p>
          <p><em>Kids, a lot of weird, random things have happened in my life, </em></p>
          <p>but that car accident is one of the few I'd call a miracle, not because of what happened, but because of what happened next.[/i]</p>
          <p>Hi.</p>
          <p>Hi.</p>
          <p>Can I talk to you?</p>
          <p>Okay.</p>
          <p>I got you this orange kangaroo.</p>
          <p>Uh... thanks.</p>
          <p>So I've been thinking about what changed from the moment I broke up with you to the moment I knew I wanted you back.</p>
          <p>And, um, I think I finally figured out what happened.</p>
          <p>Your cab got T-boned by a jackass on a cell phone?</p>
          <p>No. I changed.</p>
          <p>I'm ready to give you what you need.</p>
          <p>That's why I spent ten minutes on the damn claw machine trying to get the big, fake diamond ring.</p>
          <p>But all I could get was this orange kangaroo.</p>
          <p>Diamond ring?</p>
          <p>Will you marry me?</p>
