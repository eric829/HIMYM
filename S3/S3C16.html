        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: Now kids, When aunt Robin was the teenager. She was, well, the Canadian pop star. But by 2008, she was the entirely different person.</p>
        <p><em>Robin is presenting the news.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Coming up next, 'Is your baby trying to kill you?'</p>
        <p><em>At the Bar</em></p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: Which maybe events that week, all the more surprising.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: So, I got up this morning, its freezing. So I walked over there. And I don't know why I am still talking. Because clearly we are all asking the same question. What in God's creation is going on with Robin's breasts.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: I know, right, isn't that amazing? I spent half an hour making these happen. Its tape in there, cotton balls, half of a Nerf football, but it works, right?</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Totally. What's the occasion?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: And old friend from Canada is in town and I'm meeting him for a drink.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Ooh! Somebody you went to Degrassi with?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: No. Actually, he was my first boyfriend.</p>
        <p>[FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><em>A young man is at the beach, Robin joins him.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Simon. I thought he was the coolest guy ever. He smelled like Drakkar. He could ollie on a skateboard. He had the most amazing collection of Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts. We spent the whole summer madly in love.</p>
        <p>[END OF FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Tell me more. Tell me more. Like, did he have a car?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: So he's the guy who... How shall I say this like a gentleman? Robin, did he take your maple leaf?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: No, it wasn't like that.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Sounds to me like he gave you your first &quot;O, Canada!&quot; face.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: This went on for a really long time. Some of them jokes were elegant and well-crafted...</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Wait, wait. Did he break up with you and tell you he's just not that Inuit?</p>
        <p>(laughing)</p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>:...others were crude, and ill-formed...</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Um, something about fur trapping.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>:...and others were obvious, but needed to be said...</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Did you ride his Zamboni?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Wait, wait, wait. Did he...? I think I'm out.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Yeah, I'm also &quot;oot. Okay, now I'm really out.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Well, I'm sorry, guys. It was all very tame. We only dated for a week and a half.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Wha...? I thought you said you were together all summer.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Yeah. Summer in Canada is pretty much the last week of July. Anyway, one night, his band just finish playing this gig...</p>
        <p>[FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><em>Robin is lifting a big box into the trunk of a van.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Oh, my God! Simon. That was such a good show. You guys totally rocked out.</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Yeah. I know. I figure we're about four or five gigs away from really exploding. We're gonna be big, babe. I mean, like Crash-Test-Dummies big. So, that everything? All right. Listen, babe... It's over.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: What?</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: I'm getting back together with Louise Marsh.</p>
        <p>[END OF FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Louise Marsh?! That's a whore's name if I ever heard one.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Yeah, why would he want to get back together with Louise Marsh?</p>
        <p>[FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Well, the thing is... her folks just put in a pool.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Oh... So... I totally... I get it. Pools are great. Swimming's awesome. We have a sprinkler. Run right through it. Well, I should go.</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Uh... Babe, wait.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Yeah, Simon?</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: You forgot to load the drum set.</p>
        <p>[END OF FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: No! Tell me you did not load the drum set.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: I did.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: And now he's coming here? Robin, why do you want to see this guy?</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Oh! I know why. You're gonna win, aren't you?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: I have no idea what you' talking about.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Yes, you do. Whenever you haven't seen someone for a long time, no matter how much you want to deny it, there's always a clear winner and a clear loser.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Well, since you brought it up, let's add up the points.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: You're starting out with two big ones right there.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Thank you. Okay. So, Simon still lives with his mom.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Point Robin.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Um, he never became a rock star.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Point Robin.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: He now works at a water slide park outside of Ottawa.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Point Simon.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Wait. Do they have a wave pool?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: No.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Ah. Point Robin. That's five-zip. There's no coming back from that.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Yeah, he's going down. I mean, unless somehow, he got hotter. There he is.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: And sure enough, there was a clear winner, and a clear loser. It just wasn't clear to everybody.</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Hey, babe.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>, <em>giggling</em>: Oh, my God.</p>
        <p>[OPENING CREDITS]</p>
        <p><em>At the apartment</em></p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Okay, what the hell just happened?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Oh, come on, it wasn't so bad, was it?</p>
        <p><em>(The others groan)</em></p>
        <p>[FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Hey, Simon.</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Wow, look at you. You got old.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Yeah. You look great. You got hotter, like that's possible.</p>
        <p>[END OF FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: So... Look, I know it didn't go as planned, but I can't help it. I mean... he's still got it.</p>
        <p>[FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Whoa! Four bucks for a brew? What a rip. Good thing I'm packing.</p>
        <p><em>(He takes a can out of his pants)</em></p>
        <p>[END OF FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: So he's not a snob. He's from a different part of Canada, you know? The maple leaf flag on the back of the pickup truck? He's Red Province. He's from the Deep North.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: The thing is, we gave you so many opportunities.</p>
        <p>[FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: So, Simon, Robin's a bit of a local celebrity here in New York. She's the lead anchor at Metro News One. Tell him, Robin.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: No. It's stupid. It's not cool, like Simon's shirt.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: I'm sorry, Simon. Here we are nattering on about our big celebrity. What do you do for a living?</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Oh, I work at the Splish Splash Ottawa Water Slide Park.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Huh! A water slide park. That sure is different than what Robin does.</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Yeah, it is... because I save lives. If I'm not sitting in that stool at the top of the slide, going... Go.. Go... Go... people die. What, you think it's so easy? You try it.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Um... <em>(clears his throat</em>)... okay. Go.</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: You didn't put your hand up; kid just died.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: No, I didn't know...</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Another kid just went; he died too.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Oh, well, sure. I mean, if I was actually...</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Another kid just went; now you've got a pile-up and Robin's got something to report on the news. This just in: My friend, Ted, just killed a bunch of kids today.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Well, that's cool. You got to pay the bills somehow since your whole music thing didn't really pan out, did it?</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Well, it hasn't panned out yet, but the band's still going. About four or five gigs away from really exploding.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: The Foreskins are still playing?</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: The Foreskins? How'd you guys come up with that name?</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Well, there's four of us, and we play without shirts. Babe, seriously.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: I know. I'm sorry.</p>
        <p>[END OF FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: I know. I'm sorry. But you guys just don't understand. The fact that he kept the band going...that's impressive! I mean, I gave up my musical dream.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Which brings us to the most important piece of information from tonight.</p>
        <p>[FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: So, Simon, how did you guys meet?</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Oh, I was in her video.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Starred in it is more like it.</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Well, once you win Mr. Teen Winnipeg, everybody wants a piece of the moneymaker.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: I'm sorry. I've seen &quot;Let's Go to the Mall&quot; about a thousand times, and you, sir, are not in it.</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: No, I was in the other one.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: There's another video?!</p>
        <p>[END OF FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Robin, seriously, just make this easier on yourself and give us the tape.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: No.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: All right! You leave me no choice. From this moment on, I will spend every waking minute ching down this tape. I will not sleep. I will not eat. My life will be a living hell of search engines and overseas phone calls, chasing down something that possibly can't be found.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Okay.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: It's just... It was so hard to watch, Robin. You're usually so cool.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm sitting next to Simon, and suddenly I'm 16 again.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Oh, it's actually a common thing. When you're around someone from your past, you kind of revert back to who you were when you knew them. There's not really a name for it, though.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: It's called &quot;revertigo.&quot;</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Yeah, I don't know about &quot;revertigo.&quot;</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: You know who gets really bad revertigo? <em>(whispers)</em> Lily when she around her high school friend, Michelle.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Michelle? She sounds hot.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: You don't know about Lily and Michelle?</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: No. What about Lily and Michelle?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Oh, my friend, you are in for a treat. Hey, Lil?</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: What?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: You know, I was just thinking, we haven't seen your friend Michelle in a while.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call, see if she wants to hang out.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: What... <em>(stammers</em>) Do they make out?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Better.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Comparable.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Comparable.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Whatever. It's over. I lost. I guess you, uh, you don't get second chance.</p>

        <p><em>Later, at the Bar</em></p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: I got a second chance.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: What happened?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: He came by my place tonight...</p>
        <p>[FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Simon. What are you doing here?</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: I just feel like there's some unfinished business between you and me. Seeing you now... has made me realize that breaking up with you is the biggest mistake I made in my entire life.</p>
        <p>[END OF FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Oh, I like where this is going.</p>
        <p>[FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: I know this is crazy, and I'm only in town for a couple of days, but do you want to go on a date?</p>
        <p>[END OF FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: He asked you out?! Oh, step into my web, Simon.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: The coup de grace.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Finish him!</p>
        <p>[FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: I'd love to!</p>
        <p>[END OF FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Wait. You're going on a date with Simon? That Simon?The one we met?</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Robin, this guy doesn't deserve a second chance. Not after the way he treated you.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: That was ten years ago. People evolve. I mean, are you the same person that you were in high school?</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Oh, hell, no!</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: I think you're gonna enjoy this.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: That my girl Michelle?</p>
        <p><strong>Michelle</strong>: Bitch, you know it!</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: How she livin'?</p>
        <p><strong>Michelle</strong>: She living only way she know how to. Large!</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Oh, girl, you gots to get your drink on up in here.</p>
        <p><strong>Michelle</strong>: I'm hoping my big ass can hustle me up a vodka-Gatorade.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: For reals.</p>
        <p><em>(Lily and Michelle leave the bar together</em>)</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: I want her around all the time. I'd even consider not trying to sleep with her if that's what it takes. Guys, I've decided to seduce Michelle.</p>
        <p><em>In some garage</em></p>
        <p><em>(Robin is watching Simon's band playing)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Yeah!</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Guys, that was great. Let's take five. Hey, babe, did you like it after my bass solo when I flicked my pick at you?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: That rocked.</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Yeah. Uh, 'cause I'm gonna need that pick back.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Oh, uh, sure.</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Um, I think it... It's cool. You'll find it later.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Oh, cool. I wish I didn't have to go to work in the morning.</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Oh, but, babe, you got to go to work. You got to play our demo on your show.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Oh, well, you know, it's not a show. It's the news.</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Right. So you can be, like &quot;Hey, did you hear there's some news? There's a rad band you guys should check out.&quot; And then play it. Or just, like, the first three songs.</p>
        <p><em>Robin is presenting the news...</em></p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: And now it's time for &quot;Puppy Corner,&quot; some little angels looking for a new home, courtesy of the Midtown Animal Shelter.</p>
        <p><em>Dog's pictures are shown with Simon's music in the background (hard-metal music)</em></p>
        <p><em>At the Bar</em></p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Hey, a lot of puppies got adopted. Of course, a lot of the people calling in thought we were going to kill them.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Robin, your revertigo is really starting to affect your work.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: What's revertigo?</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: It's a stupid, made-up word with no meaning.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: No. It's a phenomenon where, when you're around people from your past, you start behaving like them.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Oh. One example of that springs to mind. I think we all know what it is.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: You do?</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Yeah. Ted.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Me?</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Whenever Ted's friend Punchy comes into town, it's like, all of a sudden, Ted's in high school again.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Okay, okay. First of all, his name is Adam Punciarello, and I don't do that.</p>

        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: You want to go?</p>
        <p><strong>Punchy</strong>: I'm already there!</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Dude, seriously, I'm sorry about your dad.</p>
        <p><strong>Punchy</strong>:Yeah, it was a real shock.</p>
        <p>[END OF FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: I can't believe you, of all people, are saying this.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Why?</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: No reason.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Robin, the point is, what are you doing? I mean, this guy?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Okay, you want the truth? Yeah. I like Simon. I do. We have fun together.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Oh, we know you do, honey, but we're worried about you.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: You're worried? Okay, hold on. Is there any version of this conversation where you guys don't sound like my parents?</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: I don't know. Is there any version where you don't sound like a 16-year-old?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: That's exactly what my mom would say.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: No. If I was your mom, I woulsay, &quot;We forbid you from seeing this boy.&quot;</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Lily!</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: No, I'm sorry, but it's for your own good.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: This is my life! You guys just don't get it! You've never felt the way that I feel!</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Now, now. We were once young and in love, too.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Yeah, like, a billion years ago.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: You've been drinking, haven't you?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Yeah, we all have. You bought the last round.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: You're not going to that show tonight!</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Oh, yes, I am, and you know what else? Tonight, after the show, Simon and I are going all the way.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Young lady, get back here! Thanks for your help.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Hey, so, today at work...</p>

        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Oh, hey, Simon. Great show. You guys still rock.</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Yeah. They totally dug my bass solo. Man! Why can't I always feel this alive?!</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: God, I just love seeing you so happy.</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Yeah. About that. Listen, babe. It's over.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: What?</p>
        <p><strong>Simon</strong>: I'm getting back together with Louise Marsh.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin,</strong> <em>laughing</em>: What? You're kidding me. You're breaking up with me? Again? F-For the same ex-girlfriend? In the same van? What is it? Her-Her parents got a pool? Is that still the reason?</p>
        <p><em>At the Bar</em></p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Well... I'm sorry, Robin.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: I'm fine, really.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Oh, Robin, I'm gonna tell you for real. Simon's a dawg. You feel me, Chelle?</p>
        <p><strong>Michelle</strong>: Mm-hmm, for reals. He a scrub.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Mm. True dat. I'ma get me my champagne and grape soda on.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: So, how's Columbia?</p>
        <p><strong>Michelle</strong>: Great! I'm almost done with my dissertation. Hmm. I'm getting a PhD in behavioral psychology.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Um, can I make an observation?</p>
        <p><strong>Michelle</strong>: Oh. I know. Whenever I'm around Lily, she just brings out that side of me. There's a psychological term for the phenomenon.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Revertigo?</p>
        <p><strong>Michelle</strong>:No. Actually, it's associative regression. You see, the neural pathways that... Oh, no, you did not just put on my jam! Oh. Put your hands up, girl!</p>
        <p><em>(Lily and Michelle start dancing around)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: One by one, we all had to go home. Soon, it was just Robin.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: All right. I can't find your video. I've wasted three days tr... What's the matter?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Uh... Simon dumped me in his van after the show.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Yeah, Robin, that was, like, ten years ago.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: No, tonight.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Ooh. Really? <em>(Robin starts crying)</em>Oh! Oh, come here.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: It's just... when I was young, I was so... vulnerable and-and open to things, you know? And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again. I wanted to be 16 again.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Robin, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth. You want to be 16 again? I have watched your first Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times, and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend. It's because you were totally, totally lame back then. But now, come on. Pa-cow! You're the most awesome person I have ever known. Well, second most awesome.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Right. Of course, the-the first being you.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: No. No. The first is this guy who lives in a place called the mirror. What up?! I'm saying that you are way more awesome than Simon ever will be.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Barney, do you want to come back to my place?</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Your place?</p>
        <p><em>At Robin's</em></p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Are you sure you want to do this?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Yeah. I am. Let's just not tell anyone about this, okay?</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Of course. So, should I just put it in?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Yeah, why not?</p>
        <p><em>(Barney plays a video tape)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: This was my big artistic follow-up to&quot;Let's Go to the Mall.&quot; It kind of tanked.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Is that Tiffany? Mm-hmm. You are so rad. It's everything I want it to be and more.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Oh, I'm so glad.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Is that Alan Thicke?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: You know, if you reedit it, there's a tampon commercial in here somewhere. Do you seem how lame you were back then?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Yeah, you're right. I was lame.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Totally lame. Ugh. And, of course, the robot makes an appearance in the sad love ballad.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: He was my sidekick. He had to be.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: And so they watched it again... And again... And again. They watched it over and over that night until finally... (<em>Robin and Barney kiss)</em> they stopped watching.</p>
