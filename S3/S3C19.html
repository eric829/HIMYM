        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: Kids, in the spring of 2008 something kind of strange have been happening to your uncle Barney. He's been doing great with a woman.</p>
        <p><em>At the Bar</em></p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: So I threw the pressure air oxygen into its mouth. I shoot the tank, boo, nomore shark. Mr. Hall and I swam back to shore. Hey,let me serve you a drink.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: He's only been gone a few moments but when he return...</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: So where were we?</p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030:...</strong>he gets slap! It kept happening...</p>
        <p><em>(The woman slaps him.)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Woman</strong>: Jerk!</p>
        <p>[FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><em>A woman slaps Barney, at a pet shop, then at the museum, and at the hardware store.</em></p>
        <p>[END OF FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: Until finally Lily was approached by a mysterious woman who wants her stay away from Barney...so when it happened once more...</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Again? Really? Wait...</p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: Barney knew who to look for...</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Hey, excuse me. Did I sleep with you and then totally screw you over?</p>
        <p><strong>Woman</strong>: No.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: What are you doing on Friday?</p>
        <p><em>(He runs after another woman, who just climbed into a cab.)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Stop! Amy?</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: Abby.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Riiiggghhhttt!!!</p>
        <p>[OPENING CREDITS]</p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: Kids, sometimes you can do something right a thousand times in a row...</p>
        <p><em>In Lily's class</em></p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: A rainbow! That's beautiful! What a beautiful rainbow! Another rainbow? It's beautiful!</p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: But then, that thousand-and-first time...</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: You're kidding me. Seriously, aren't you sick of these things?</p>
        <p><em>At the appartment</em></p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Hey, how was your day?</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Today, I yelled at a little girl for painting a rainbow.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: A rainbow? Sounds like that bitch had it coming.</p>
        <p><em>(Marshall arrives)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: So, uh, I just met with the contractor. and it turns out, that fixing the floors of the new apartment is going to cost a lot more than the estimate.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: But we can barely afford that to begin with.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: I hate to say this, but I think you're going to have to sell your stuff.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Whoa! Marshall, that's just a game we play in the bedroom.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: I mean your clothes. All those designer pieces and everything.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: What? Why just my clothes?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: We can sell my stuff, too, but I got to tell you, I think your Marc Jacobs cocktail dress is going to go for a lot more than my &quot;Split Happens&quot; bowling shirt.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Dude.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: I'm not selling that. I've already made the Website.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: You made a Website?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Yeah, it's called &quot;Lily-and-Marshall-sell- their-stuff-dot-com.&quot;</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: No, you know what would be a better name for the site? Guy-forces-his-wife- to-dress-in-a-garbage-bag- for-the-next- three-years-dot-com. That's real.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: I'm worried. That woman is actually wearing a-a garbage bag.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Hmm, but, girlfriend, you cannot pull off a tall kitchen.</p>
        <p><em>In the cab</em></p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Why are you trying to ruin my life?</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: Well, you slept with me and then you never called me again.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: And?</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: That's it.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: That's it? As far as I'm concerned, if I leave you safe on dry land with adequate transportation home, you've got nothing to complain about.</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: Well, it hurt, okay? And then Ted, the love of my life started dating my boss instead of me. Do you know how that feels?</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Oh, boo-hoo, poor little Ashley.</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: Abby!</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Abby. A few weeks ago, Ted dumped me as his wingman. You had a crush on him for a couple weeks? I was Ted's best friend for seven years.</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: Ted said Marshall was his best friend.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Seven years!</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: Sorry.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Ted. What an idiot. With his stupid &quot;meaningful relationship&quot; with Stella.</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: I hate Ted.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: I hate Ted more.</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: Are you as turned on as I am?</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Probably not quite as much.</p>
        <p><em>(Later, they are both in bed...)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: I'm sorry I yelled out &quot;Ted.&quot;</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: I'm sorry I yelled out &quot;Abby.&quot;</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: I am Abby.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Oh, cool.</p>
        <p><em>At the apartment</em></p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: This is insane. Has Lily even worn half this stuff?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Oh, yeah, like there's nothing in your closet you've never worn?</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: As a matter of fact, no, there isn't.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Whatever, red cowboy boots.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Those are nice boots. I totally pull those off.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Hey, Lil, if I were to say &quot;Ted could never pull them off,&quot; What would I be talking about?</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: His red cowboy boots.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: I totally pull them off! It's a classic Western look.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Oh, okay, uh, today's category: classic Westerns that involve red cowboy boots. Ooh, ooh! Robin.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Fabulous.&quot;</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: &quot;The Magnificent Kevin.&quot;</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: &quot;No Country for Straight Men.&quot;</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: I don't want to sell my clothes!</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Oh, I know, sweetie. Come here. Is this a hundred percent silk?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Lily,listen, we really need the money. I have some leads on a job, but until then, I just... I don't know what else we can do.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: I'll sell my paintings!</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: What?</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Yeah, I'll sell my paintings. Good oil paintings go for like, $500.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Yeah. Totally. But...</p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: Kids, sometimes you can do something right a thousand times in a row...</p>
        <p>[FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><em>Lily shows her paintings to Marshall)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: I love it. It's a masterpiece. That's it. We're selling the TV. I just want to come home and stare at this all day. Aw. Somebody call the cops! My wife stole an awesome painting from the museum!</p>
        <p>[END OF FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: But then, that thousand-and-first time...</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>:...that kind of money only goes for real paintings.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Look, it just, it just means that-that we need money right now and I'm not sure that selling your paintings is-is how we're going to get it.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: You don't believe in me.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: No, wait, wait! Of c... of course I believe in you!</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Marshall, I am proud of my work as an artist. My paintings are good. I bet Robin would buy one. What now?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: I love your painting, I just... I'm trying to be realistic.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Well, how much money do we need for the contractor to finish the job?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: About 1,500 bucks.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Okay. So, if I can sell three of my paintings at 500 bucks a pop, then I get to keep all my clothes.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Babe, we need money fast.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Well, give me a week.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Okay, a-a week.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Fine.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Fine.</p>
        <p><em>(Ted comes out of his room, with the red boots on.)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Pulling... Them... Off.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: Lily's first move on a great art challenge of 2008 was to display one of her favorite paintings at her friend's gallery. The night didn't go so well. But then at the last minute...</p>
        <p><strong>Woman</strong>: I love it.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: You do?</p>
        <p><strong>Woman</strong>: Yeah, your top. It's gorgeous. Is that 100% silk?</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: It's not for sale! My clothes are not for sale!</p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: So the next day, Lily took her painting to a coffee house that displayed local artists.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: We've been sitting here for hours and nobody's even glanced at my painting. Come on. Let's start talking it up.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Wow! I really like that painting! It's neat! The-the colors are neat. The-the shapes are neat. It's really just... neat. What?</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Observe. I think there's a dynamic quality to the brushwork that, combined with the fluid composition, creates an almost Kandinsky-like emotional resonance.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Yes, and you can still enjoy it even if you're not a pretentious douche.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Can you clarify something for me about your critique? Are the colors &quot;neat&quot; or are they more &quot;neato burrito?&quot;</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Uh, then again, red cowboy boots.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: I pull these off! (<em>Everyone is laughing at him)</em> I pull these off!</p>
        <p><em>In bed...</em></p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: You know what I hate most about Ted?</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: What?</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: His stupid hair. His stupid, lame awesome hair. It's so stupid and awesome.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: You know what I hate most about Ted?</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: What?</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: How he's always like, &quot;Oh, I want to fall in love and have a relationship. I care about the people I have s*x with.&quot; He's so lame.</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: He's so lame and awesome.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: You know what he needs? He needs to see just how horrible he is when he's in a relationship.</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: Yeah, and I need to show Ted that I'm over him. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: I think so.</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: You're thinking of having s*x with Ted?</p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: After four days without selling a single painting, Lily was getting desperate.</p>
        <p><em>In the street</em></p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Painting for sale! $500! Lifelong dream hanging in the balance! It's like they don't even see us.</p>
        <p><strong>Man</strong>: Yeah, we're dirt to them. What do you need money for?</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Oh, I'm trying to fix the hardwood floors in my new apartment. You?</p>
        <p><strong>Man</strong>: Heroin.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Do you like heroin?</p>
        <p><strong>Man</strong>: Love it. In fact, if you sell that, I'm going to take your money and go buy some more heroin.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Thanks for your honesty, Crazy Sock Guy. Oh, I'm never gonna sell this...</p>
        <p><strong>Man</strong>: It's not very good.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: And just as she was about to lose all hope, something amazing happened.</p>
        <p><strong>Man: 2</strong> Oh, my God!</p>
        <p><em>At the Bar</em></p>
        <p><em>(Lily arrives)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: 500 bucks! Who's a real painter now, Marshall?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Honey, I never said you weren't a real painter.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Oh, I know, sweetie. And since I'm a professional artist now, I'm going to sketch you an Aldrin original, you know, to say thanks for being such a supportive husband. I'm thinking about calling it... &quot;Suck It!&quot;</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Lily, come on. I'm proud of you. Who-who bought it?</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Well, that's the best part. A gay couple without kids. A G-CWOK!</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: You bagged a G-CWOK?!</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Yeah, that's right. They are the heart and soul of the art-buying community.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: You know what you should do? You should call up the G-CWOKs and offer them a free painting if they throw a private art party for all their G-CWOK friends.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: That's an amazing idea. I'm going to go call them. I can probably sell two more paintings with time to spare. Oh, wait, Marshall. There was something I had to tell you. What was it? Oh, that's right. Suck it.</p>

        <p><em>(Barney and Abby arrives as Lily is leaving)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Ted, fancy bumping into you here. Have you guys met my girlfriend Abby?</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Uh, yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Hi, Abby.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Hello, Abby. So, uh, s-so you guys are dating now?</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: That's right. I am done with this whole being awesome thing. Now I'm all about farmers' markets and day hikes in matching khaki cargo shorts. Isn't that right, sweetie?</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: That's right. And girlfriends are lame. Unless they're me. I miss you, Ted.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Abby and I are in love. Not hot passionate love. Couple love. You know, movie night with my girlfriend, then waiting for her to go to bed so I can steal one pitiful moment of hollow ecstasy by the cold, blue light of my computer monitor.</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: We're showing Ted how lame he is.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: You don't have to say it, though.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Uh, okay, Barney, you can stop.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Stop what, Ted? Stop being in love? Next he'll ask us to stop breathing.</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: We can't stop breathing, Ted. Your hair looks amazing.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Um, Barney, I, I see what you're doing. Please stop.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Not before I share with you what being in a relationship leads to, Ted. Abby, Pookie Bear... I am so pathetically desperate for you that... aw, heck, I'll just say it. Would you marry me?</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: Wait, really?</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: I would never joke about true love.</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: Yes, I'll marry you.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Okay.</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: Thank you, thank you. I have to call my mom.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: That's you.</p>
        <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Uh, yeah, I don't think Abby knows you're kidding.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Uh, yes, she does.</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: It finally happened, Mama. I just wish Daddy were alive to walk me down the aisle.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Totally committed to the bit.</p>
        <p><em>Lily's on the phone</em></p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Yes, Lily Aldrin. I sold you the painting earlier today.</p>
        <p><strong>Man 2</strong>: Oh, honey, hello.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: You sound happy.</p>
        <p><strong>Man 2</strong>: Are you kidding? We're popping the champagne right now.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Well, I just wanted to offer you an exclusive chance to view some of my other paintings.</p>
        <p><strong>Man 2</strong>: Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, oh, I guess I should have told you. We just bought that for the frame.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: What?</p>
        <p><strong>Man 2</strong>: Yeah, it's an original Anton Kreutzer, a very rare frame from the turn of the century.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: So... y-you didn't like my painting?</p>
        <p><strong>Man 2</strong>: Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, no, not at all. But you know, good for you.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Okay. Well, if you didn't want the painting, can I... can I at least get it back?</p>
        <p><strong>Man 2</strong>: Yeah, no, we don't have it anymore.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Where is it? I see. H-He threw out my painting.</p>
        <p><strong>Man 2</strong>: Champagne for everyone on me, the happiest guy in the world.</p>
        <p><em>At the apartment</em></p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: This is great. My dream of becoming an artist is dead, and now I'm watching my wardrobe disappear piece by piece. There goes my favorite dress. This dress meant a lot to me.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: Really?</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Yeah. It was spring of 2004 and I had been having a hard few months.</p>

        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Really? Why?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Because I felt guilty. This auction was my idea and now you've had to sit around all day while a bunch of vultures ruthlessly pick apart the carcass of your wardrobe.</p>
        <p><strong>Robin</strong>: It's still in the family.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: And more importantly, I honestly love that painting and I couldn't stand to think of it in a trashcan someplace.</p>

I noticed your painting just sitting right there on top and I thought, &quot;Hey,free painting,&quot; so I brought it upstairs and hung it up in Exam Room 3, and then the strangest thing happened. Hey, Muffin. Whoa, I think he remembers me from the last time he was here. Take Muffin to Exam Room 3. I'll meet you there. I went in, expecting the worst. I'd never seen Muffin that calm, and then a little later the same thing happened again with Tidbit... and King Larry... and again with the Weinstein triplets.</p>
        <p>[END OF FLASHBACK]</p>
        <p><strong>Dr Greer</strong>: Something about your art speaks to the canine sensibility on a very primal level.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Really? Dogs like my paintings?</p>
        <p><strong>Dr Greer</strong>: Yeah. But you know who it bums out? Birds. Yeah. Had a parrot in there today. He took one look at it, pried open his cage, flew right into the ceiling fan.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Anyway, because your first painting worked so well, I convinced Dr. Greer to buy four more.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Really?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Mm-hmm, at $500 a piece.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: That's two grand. That's more than we need for the contractor.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Yeah, but I was actually thinking we could reinvest it.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: In what?</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: In you.</p>
        <p><em>At the apartment</em></p>
        <p><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>: Marshall explained that he was building a fancy new Web site specifically to sell Lily's artwork to veterinarians.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: Well, it's not exactly the clientele I had in mind, but... thank you for believing in me.</p>
        <p><em>(They kiss; a bird crashes into their window)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Man, birds do not get you.</p>
        <p><em>At Abby's</em></p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: Hi, sweetie.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Hey, I think I left my tie here. Have you seen it?</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: No, I'm in wedding-planning mode. Stressville. Population: me. Okay, big decision. What do you think the cake should be: Fudgie the Whale or Cookie Puss?</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Yeah, that was a bit. We were doing a bit.</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: So I'm thinking Labor Day. I was going to say Fourth of July, but I don't want to steal any attention away from America.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Abby, I've... I've got some bad news. I can't marry you.</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: What?</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Ted begged me not to. I think he's in love with you.</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: Really?</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Yes, our plan worked better than we ever dreamed. You have to go to him. Here's his home address. But you know what? He works late, so I wouldn't go before 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.</p>
        <p><strong>Abby</strong>: Oh, my God, thank you. But now I feel wrong keeping this.</p>
        <p><strong>Barney</strong>: Oh, yeah, I wouldn't worry about that. That's made of candy. Later.</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Hey, go to lilyandmarshallselltheirstuff.com or charityfolks.com.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily</strong>: We're having an auction to rise money for the children's hospital of Los Angeles</p>
        <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: You could get tons of cool stuff on the sell and they all use for great cause.</p>
        <p><strong>Lily &amp; Marshall</strong>: Thanks.</p>
