        <p>8 - Spoiler Alert</p>
        <p><em>Kids, the early bloom of a romance is a wonderful thing. You meet someone, you have a connection, and that person becomes sheer perfection in your eyes. You just can't find anything wrong with them. And you can't wait to tell the world about it.</em></p>
        <p>She convinced you to go jogging?</p>
        <p>Wow, you really want to get in this girl's pants.</p>
        <p>I'm telling you, you guys are gonna love her.</p>
        <p>Lily, she knows all about art.</p>
        <p>Marshall, she's open to the existence of UFOs.</p>
        <p>Barney, she's hot. Robin, she's not hotter than you.</p>
        <p>Like her already.</p>
        <p>How not hotter?</p>
        <p><em>So we all went out to dinner, and I couldn't wait to see if my friends were as crazy about Cathy as I was.</em></p>
        <p>So, what's everyone getting?</p>
        <p>Well, I can't decide.</p>
        <p>Which sounds better, chicken or lasagna?</p>
        <p>Lasagna. Just get the lasagna!</p>
        <p>Oh. You guys just got a new place.</p>
        <p>How many bedrooms is it?</p>
        <p>Two. It's two bedrooms!</p>
        <p>Okay! Let's hear it.</p>
        <p>What's wrong with Cathy?</p>
        <p>Are you kidding me, Ted?</p>
        <p>She's got a...</p>
        <p>Wait! You don't notice it?</p>
        <p>Notice what?</p>
        <p>Oh, he doesn't see it.</p>
        <p>If we point it out, we're gonna ruin her for him.</p>
        <p>As his friends, we'll just keep him in the dark.</p>
        <p>You're right.</p>
        <p>She's great, man.</p>
        <p>She's a keeper. Just... keep her somewhere else.</p>
        <p>Marshall, what is everyone's problem with Cathy?</p>
        <p>Oh, she's a total nightmare, Ted, but can we talk about this later?</p>
        <p>I'm a minute away from finding out if I'm gonna be a lawyer or not.</p>
        <p><em>You see, kids, during the summer, Marshall had taken the New York Bar exam. His years of school, his countless hours of study, had finally culminated in this grueling, two-day ordeal.</em></p>
        <p>And... begin.</p>
        <p><em>The pressure of it was enormous. Every year, people taking the bar simply cracked. But Marshall had made it through.</em></p>
        <p>And...</p>
        <p>time.</p>
        <p>Time's up.</p>
        <p>Right.</p>
        <p>Time.</p>
        <p>Sir.</p>
        <p>I know.</p>
        <p>Your time is...</p>
        <p>I know it is.</p>
        <p>Give me...!</p>
        <p><em>Now, months later, the results of that exam were scheduled to post online at 10:00, and it was 9:59.</em></p>
        <p>Damn, they're not up yet.</p>
        <p>Oh, don't worry, baby. I'm sure you rocked it.</p>
        <p>I mean, how many people fail the bar?</p>
        <p>Half.</p>
        <p>Oh, my God, half? Only half the people pass?</p>
        <p>I mean, half the people pass. That's fantastic.</p>
        <p>Go, Marshall.</p>
        <p>Oh, hey, can I jump on there? I want to show you something awesome.</p>
        <p>What? No, no. Bar results. My future.</p>
        <p>Trust me. You need to see this.</p>
        <p>What is so important that I need to see it right now?</p>
        <p>It's a video of a dog pooping on a baby.</p>
        <p>How do I need to see that?</p>
        <p>Why would I want to see that?</p>
        <p>In what possible way could subjecting my eyes and my brain to something that disgusting enrich my life?</p>
        <p>It's a dog pooping on a baby.</p>
        <p>Get away from my computer.</p>
        <p>Okay, just do a quick Google search for &quot;caca spaniel.&quot;</p>
        <p>The results are in.</p>
        <p>Whoo. What's it say?</p>
        <p>&quot;Input password.&quot;</p>
        <p>Input the password !</p>
        <p>It's okay. They assigned it to me when I took the test.</p>
        <p>It's gotta be around here somewhere.</p>
        <p>Here. Here-here-here-here.</p>
        <p>Jelly beans, fluffernutter, Gummi Bears, ginger snaps...</p>
        <p>This is a grocery list For who? A witch building a house in the forest?</p>
        <p>Sugar helps me study.</p>
        <p>This is like the shopping a ten-year-old does when his parents leave him alone for the weekend.</p>
        <p>What parent leaves a ten-<br />
        year-old alone for the weekend?</p>
        <p>And your mom was perfect.</p>
        <p>I can't find my password!</p>
        <p>Okay, just... can't you let 'em know that you lost it and they'll e-mail it to you or something?</p>
        <p>No! They won't let me do that. I'm gonna have to wait till the results come in the regular mail. That could be weeks from now, if ever!</p>
        <p>Our mail carrier hates me ever since I asked her when the baby was due.</p>
        <p>She wasn't pregnant?</p>
        <p>No, he was not.</p>
        <p>Okay, well, that's a drag, but the results will come eventually.</p>
        <p>Just try to keep it off your mind until then.</p>
        <p>Hey, Brad.</p>
        <p>Oh, congratulations, man.</p>
        <p>I'm, uh... I'm not sure yet. I...</p>
        <p>lost my password.</p>
        <p>That's great, Cara.</p>
        <p>I don't know yet. I lost my password.</p>
        <p>I don't know how I lost it!</p>
        <p>This stuff happens!</p>
        <p>You're one to talk. You misplace stuff all the time.</p>
        <p>I'm sorry. I'm sure the nurses are stealing your medicine, Grandma.</p>
        <p>Love you, too.</p>
        <p>If I have to wait six weeks to find out if I passed, I'm gonna have a heart attack.</p>
        <p>Based on that grocery list, I'd say diabetes is a bigger worry.</p>
        <p>You know what? Laugh all you want.</p>
        <p>This affects my whole future, all right?</p>
        <p>Okay. I probably shouldn't be telling you this.</p>
        <p>I definitely shouldn't be telling you this, but there is a way I can help you with your problem.</p>
        <p>How?</p>
        <p>I know a guy at work.</p>
        <p>He can get access to software designed to penetrate firewalls and retrieve passwords through secure servers.</p>
        <p>I can get into any computer.</p>
        <p>So what do we do?</p>
        <p>Like, arrange a secret meeting in a darkened parking structure?</p>
        <p>No.</p>
        <p>Can we?</p>
        <p>No.</p>
        <p>I have a trench coat.</p>
        <p>Dude, be cool.</p>
        <p>So, I just got off the phone with Cathy.</p>
        <p>God, you guys are so right. I totally hear it now.</p>
        <p>See it now?</p>
        <p>Smell it?</p>
        <p>What is it?!</p>
        <p>I left the table for two minutes.</p>
        <p>What could she have possibly done in that time that was so horrible?</p>
        <p>Was it...</p>
        <p>I'll be back in one second.</p>
        <p>One time, in the tenth grade, as a joke, I told everyone that my English teacher had s*x with me.</p>
        <p>He's still in jail.</p>
        <p>Or maybe...</p>
        <p>I'll be back in a second.</p>
        <p>So I volunteer at the pound.</p>
        <p>Oh, isn't that nice?</p>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        <p>You can't imagine the rush you get from killing an unwanted puppy.</p>
        <p>I make bracelets out of the collars.</p>
        <p>Or...</p>
        <p>I'll be back in one second.</p>
        <p>I bet he's going to the urinal.</p>
        <p>Yeah. I remember when I had a pen1s.</p>
        <p>It wasn't anything she did while you were in the bathroom.</p>
        <p>It's just the way she is.</p>
        <p>I don't get it. If it's so obvious and you guys all see it, how come I don't?</p>
        <p>'Cause we're not trying to have s*x with her.</p>
        <p>Brother, you're driving the &quot;I want to have s*x with her&quot; truck, and it's got a huge blind spot.</p>
        <p>That's ridiculous.</p>
        <p>Is it really?</p>
        <p>Ted, let me tell you a little story about a young lady I wanted to have s*x with...</p>
        <p>Lucilia.</p>
        <p>On a white sand beach in Rio de Janeiro, we made love for ten straight hours.</p>
        <p>When we were done, she applauded and told me I was far, far better than the best lover she could possibly imagine, and that I had restored her faith in God.</p>
        <p>What does this have to do with Cathy?</p>
        <p>Who's Cathy?</p>
        <p>Just tell me what the hell is wrong with her already.</p>
        <p>Okay. You want to know?</p>
        <p>Yes.</p>
        <p>You want to shatter this beautiful illusion you've created for yourself?</p>
        <p>Fine. Here it is.</p>
        <p>Cathy talks...</p>
        <p>a lot.</p>
        <p>Oh, come on. That's not true.</p>
        <p>Ted. Really, really think about that dinner we all just had together.</p>
        <p><em>And I did.</em></p>
        <p>So, what's everyone getting?</p>
        <p>Well, I can't decide.</p>
        <p>Which sounds better, chicken or lasagna?</p>
        <p>I like chicken. I like lasagna. I like them both, but I really like pork. A lot of people don't eat pork, and maybe it's because of that movie Babe or something.</p>
        <p>But that was funny. He was a talking pig and he was like &quot;Bah, Ram, Ewe!&quot;</p>
        <p>What-what if there was a sorority, &quot;Bah, Ram, Ewe?&quot;</p>
        <p>I'd totally rush it. ...And so I named him Dr. Seuss!</p>
        <p>Lorax is a funny word.</p>
        <p>Lasagna! Just get the lasagna!</p>
        <p>Oh, you guys just got a new place.</p>
        <p>How many bedrooms is it?</p>
        <p>I would love to have an extra bedroom, because I would put a Stairmaster in there.</p>
        <p>But you guys should get a convertible sofa.</p>
        <p>Or a futon. Futons are great. Or what about one of those Murphy beds?</p>
        <p>Who invented the Murphy bed? Was it a guy named Murphy?</p>
        <p>Oh, my God. Do you guys remember that show Murphy Brown?</p>
        <p>That was a funny show. She had a new assistant every episode. ...and it was like half an hour before I realized he wasn't even on the phone anymore! Isn't that hysterical?</p>
        <p>Two! It's two bedrooms!</p>
        <p>Hey, do you guys like cannolis?</p>
        <p>Because I know this place and it's in the South Bronx and you wouldn't expect it, but they have the best cannolis in town.</p>
        <p><em>And just like that, the illusion was shattered.</em></p>
        <p>She just never shuts up, does she?</p>
        <p>She didn't stop to swallow her food.</p>
        <p>I was scared for her. I didn't want her to choke.</p>
        <p>At first.</p>
        <p><em>So kids, this girls I was dating would not stop talking. Can you imagine how awful that is?</em></p>
        <p>Do you own a wok?</p>
        <p>'Cause that's really how...</p>
        <p>Don't you just love autumn?</p>
        <p>Today I'm dressed for... Oh, my God. The sweetest thing.</p>
        <p>And I know this great place where we can go.</p>
        <p>They have guys and girls clothes. We could both shop at the same time.</p>
        <p>And a lot of times boyfriends and girlfriends...</p>
        <p>Hey! Why are you running so fast?</p>
        <p>Well, thank you, pal. You and your little friends, you just had to tell me.</p>
        <p>You just had to give in to my incessant begging.</p>
        <p>You said that you wanted to know.</p>
        <p>I didn't want to know!</p>
        <p>You said you wanted to know!</p>
        <p>Well, I didn't know I didn't want to know! You knew.</p>
        <p>And you know me. And you should have known I didn't want to know!</p>
        <p>You know?</p>
        <p>I'm sorry we told you. I'm surprised she didn't tell you herself at some point.</p>
        <p>There's only a finite combination of words in the English language.</p>
        <p>Well, you could have let me enjoy it a little longer.</p>
        <p>She's got all these other great qualities. She's smart.</p>
        <p>She's caring. She loves animals...</p>
        <p>You know how to teach her a lesson? Buy her a parrot.</p>
        <p>Oh, come on. I'm sorry that we told you, okay?</p>
        <p>It's part of being in a relationship.</p>
        <p>Eventually, you get used to these annoying little things that bug you at first.</p>
        <p>Yeah, I guess.</p>
        <p>I mean, you got used to Lily's loud chewing, right?</p>
        <p>Lily doesn't chew loudly.</p>
        <p>Dude... Come on. This isn't news.</p>
        <p>Why do you think I call her &quot;Chewbacca&quot;?</p>
        <p>I assumed because she's loyal, wears shiny belts and I resemble a young Harrison Ford.</p>
        <p>Think about it.</p>
        <p>Oh, man, honestly, dude, that's the meanest thing you've ever done to me.</p>
        <p>I really thought you knew.</p>
        <p>We had ribs the other night. It sounded like Jurassic Park.</p>
        <p>Ha-ha-ha. You know what? It doesn't matter.</p>
        <p><em>But it did.</em></p>
        <p>Say, what's in that cereal besides dry twigs and small animal bones?</p>
        <p>What's that supposed to mean?</p>
        <p>Lily, I love you, but honest to God, when you eat, it sounds like a garbage disposal full of drywall screws.</p>
        <p>What's the matter with you?</p>
        <p>We've been together ten years, and you're saying this now?</p>
        <p>Well, I never noticed it before until...</p>
        <p>Until what?</p>
        <p>Can you believe Ted? What a lame thing to say, that I'm a loud chewer.</p>
        <p>Yeah, that's crazy.</p>
        <p>Maybe enough with the pretzels.</p>
        <p>Oh, my God, do I really chew that loudly?</p>
        <p>No, no, no.</p>
        <p>Okay, now that you pointed it out, maybe it does sound slightly like someone put a screwdriver in a pencil sharpener, but in a cute way.</p>

        <p>This is all Ted's fault. Oh, like he's so perfect, Mr. Corrector.</p>
        <p>What do you mean?</p>
        <p>Oh, come on. You dated the guy for a year and you never noticed that most of what Ted says is correcting you.</p>
        <p>Hey, can you hand me a Kleenex?</p>
        <p>Actually, Kleenex is a brand. This is a facial tissue.</p>
        <p>Oh, my God, is Frankenstein gonna kill that little girl?</p>
        <p>Uh, Dr. Frankenstein isn't in this scene.</p>
        <p>That's Frankenstein's monster.</p>
        <p>That literally blew my mind.</p>
        <p>Figuratively.</p>
        <p>Oh, my God, you're right.</p>
        <p>That is so annoying.</p>
        <p>Isn't it?</p>
        <p>Where are those pretzels from, Ace Hardware?</p>
        <p>Hey, man, you like kettle corn? I'm trying to get rid of anything crunchy.</p>
        <p>Are the blinds closed?</p>
        <p>I don't know.</p>
        <p>Are the blinds closed?!</p>
        <p>Yes, the blinds are closed.</p>
        <p>Good, I didn't think I was followed, but you can never be too sure.</p>
        <p>Now double-lock the door and stay away from the windows.</p>
        <p>Is there a reason that you're acting like this?</p>
        <p>We're about to find out if you're a lawyer.</p>
        <p>Now, in good conscience, I have to inform you that using this software is in violation of the Patriot Act, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and the National Security Act of 1948, which created the CIA.</p>
        <p>So I hope you passed the bar because if we use this software, the night janitor Gligor who I fooled into putting fingerprints on my computer, is going to need a good lawyer.</p>
        <p>Are you certain you want to go through with this?</p>
        <p>I have to know, yes, yes.</p>
        <p>Very good.</p>
        <p>First, we go to the New York State Bar Web site.</p>
        <p>We disable the firewall, then the recursive algorithm grabs your password, and as the application erases itself leaving no trace we were here ever...</p>
        <p>you ready to see your future, bro?</p>
        <p>Yes.</p>
        <p>It's a dog pooping on a baby.</p>
        <p>Right! Isn't that awesome?</p>
        <p>So you went through all this just to get me to look at your stupid video?</p>
        <p>Yeah, it was worth it.</p>
        <p>Barney, Barney, that was the biggest test of my life.</p>
        <p>I'm incredibly stressed out right now, and I...</p>
        <p>Okay, that's pretty funny.</p>
        <p>You got to see this.</p>
        <p>Yeah, I have to...</p>
        <p>She'll call back when she realizes I'm gone.</p>
        <p>Probably in about 45 minutes.</p>
        <p>Hey.</p>
        <p>Hi.</p>
        <p>You guys want a drink?</p>
        <p>I'll just have a water.</p>
        <p>Mm, technically, water is a drink.</p>
        <p>Really, Professor? You drink it?</p>
        <p>Is that how water works?</p>
        <p>Because I was just gonna smear it on my skin and hope that I absorbed it.</p>
        <p>Or you could, you know, pour it over your shirt.</p>
        <p>What's with you?</p>
        <p>You're always correcting people.</p>
        <p>You totally do that!</p>
        <p>That's absolutely right.</p>
        <p>Right? I never noticed it before, and now it's literally driving me crazy.</p>
        <p>Figuratively.</p>
        <p>Okay, maybe so, but it's no worse than you using the word &quot;literally&quot;</p>
        <p>in every other sentence.</p>
        <p>Don't they teach vocabulary in Canada?</p>
        <p>They literally don't. They literally don't.</p>
        <p>Shut up, Marshall.</p>
        <p>That's nothing compared to your thing of singing what you do all the time.</p>
        <p>What?</p>
        <p><em>Paying my bills using return address labels From a charity that I haven't given money to Writing a check 'cause now I feel guilty The Salivation Army does not fight fair.

        <p>Those lines are so sloppy.</p>
        <p>Oh, come on!</p>
        <p>What about you, &quot;Barney&quot;?</p>
        <p>Okay, you...</p>

        <p>Interesting, interesting, everyone has annoying habits but me.</p>
        <p>Oh, got it.</p>
        <p>Okay, you sometimes talk in a weird high-pitched voice.</p>
        <p>And you're constantly using lame catchphrases.</p>
        <p>And sometimes you space out and don't even pay attention to what we're talking about.</p>
        <p>I'm sorry. What?</p>
        <p>Oh, see? You can't think of anything 'Cause I'm awesome!</p>
        <p>All three right there.</p>
        <p>Well, technically, &quot;awesome&quot; wouldn't be a catchphrase.</p>
        <p>If anything, it's more of a catchword.</p>
        <p>I literally want to rip your head off.</p>
        <p>You mean &quot;figuratively&quot;!</p>
        <p>No, I literally mean &quot;literally.&quot;</p>
        <p>Literally, literally, literally.</p>
        <p>Oh, my God, Lily, what are you eating, gravel?</p>
        <p>Oh, I know, right? It sounds like cufflinks going up a vacuum cleaner.</p>
        <p>Well, why don't you sing about it?</p>
        <p>Because I don't sing about everything I do.</p>
        <p>No, no, sometimes you just sing nonsense sentences like a stroke victim, and what's worse, they're catchy.</p>
        <p><em>Apple, orchard, banana, cat dance, 8663</em></p>
        <p>See? We know that one because once you sang that for, like, three hours. What the hell is that?</p>
        <p>That's my password.</p>
        <p>AOBCD8663.</p>
        <p>Oh, Marshall!</p>
        <p>Awesome!</p>
        <p>There's another one. It's called &quot;Golden Reliever,&quot; where this dog...</p>
        <p>Yeah, we can guess.</p>
        <p>All right, guys, guys, guys.</p>
        <p>I'm a lawyer.</p>
        <p><em>And just like that we stopped fighting and celebrated Marshall's success.</p>
        <p>You see, when someone's bad habits are pointed out to you, it's hard to ignore them.</p>
        <p>I'm a lawyer now 'cause I passed the bar I'm imposing Marshall law on this champagne.</em></p>
        <p>Oh my God, are you literally on cloud nine right now?</p>
        <p>Baby, you never have to take the bar again.</p>
        <p>Actually, if he practices law in another state, he will have to, but New York, man! It's a great state to practice law in!</p>
        <p>Lawsuit up!</p>
        <p><em>But if you love them enough, those bad habits are easy to forget. Three years later, I ran in to Cathy</em> and she was doing well.</p>
        <p>Ted?! Oh, my God, I haven't seen you in so long! How long has it been?</p>
        <p>Three years? No, four. No, three, 'cause I went blonde and then I went back 'cause I was having too much fun.</p>
        <p>It's true what they say: blondes have more fun.</p>
        <p>Oh, my God, I'm being so rude.</p>
        <p>Ted, this is my fiancé. Yes, I'm engaged.</p>
        <p>Ted, this is Daniel.</p>
        <p>Daniel... this is Ted.</p>
        <p>Great, great, nice to meet you.</p>
        <p>You guys seem perfect for each other.</p>
        <p>Oh, my God. I know, right? Totally, it was like love at first sight.</p>
        <p>Hey, we should go out sometime. Are you seeing anyone?</p>
        <p>Because we could double-date. That... ? No, it's not weird.</p>
        <p>We can go have brunch out the street. I know this place.</p>
        <p>Do you guys like popovers?</p>
        <p>Because I love popovers.</p>
        <p>She sur can talk a lot, huh?</p>
        <p>They're like croissants, but they're a little bit less flaky and they're kind of round.</p>
        <p>Hey, they have strawberry jam.</p>
